CHAPTER ONE
PRINCEALEXANDROS KAREDES, second in line to the throne of the
Kingdom of Aristo, did not like to be kept waiting.
Indeed, he never was.
Whowould be so foolish as to let a man like him cool his heels?
His own father, Alexandros thought with a sigh of resignation
as he strode past the marble fireplace outside the throne room for
what had to be the tenth time in as many minutes. The hands on
the French ormolu clock that graced the mantel stood upright at
six.Alexandros had been told the kingwould see him at five-thirty
butAegeuswas not known for promptness, even with his children.
“An unfortunate habit,” Queen Tia called it, but Alex was not
as kind. He knew his father well; he was certain Aegeus’s chronic
lateness was yet another subtle way of reminding everyone,
family included, that, though he was getting on in years, he was
still king.
It was undoubtedly the same reason he’d asked Alex to meet
him here, in such formal surroundings, rather than in the privacy
of the royal apartments.
That was just the way it was. There was no point in questioning
it. Aegeus was a more than competent ruler. He led the people
of Aristo well but he had always been distant in his dealings with
his wife, sons and daughters.
Alex had no objection. At six or seven, a display of affection,
a lessening of formalities might have meant something, but he
8 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
was thirty-one now, he had created his own eminently successful
life by bringing ever-increasing international recognition and
resources to the kingdom.
He had no need for signs of affection from his father. Affection
was for puppies and kittens, not grown men.
Alexandros glanced at the clock again.
Even though he understood the reason for it, being kept
waiting was irritating. And inconvenient. The meeting with his
father would not take long. He knew that from past experience.
He’d just returned from a business trip to the Far East. Aegeus
would simplywant to knowif things had gone well, if newbanks
and corporations would be joining the impressive list of those
already on Aristo, but he would not wish to hear the details.
Results were all that mattered, was Aegeus’s motto. How one
got to those results was immaterial.
That was okay with Alex. He didn’t need pats on the back any
more than he needed signs of affection. Itwas only that if the king
kept him waiting much longer, he’d be late getting into town.
Not that it mattered.
His new Ferrari would easily conquer the narrow roads that
wound along the cliffs looming above the Mediterranean. And
even if he arrived at The Grand Hotel in Ellos past the time he’d
told his date he’d pick her up, she would not complain.
A little smile lifted the corners of his lips.
Why be unduly modest? He did well with all the things he
most enjoyed. Beautiful women, fast cars, baccarat, the vast
business empire he’d created here and in New York.
His smile faded.
Actually, he had not done as well with women lately.
Not that they weren’t his for the taking. The woman waiting
for him tonight was what the world called a supermodel. Simone
had been doing a Vogue cover shoot outside the casino just as
Alex had arrived to discuss the casino’s expansion with its
manager, but that had not kept him from pausing to admire the
leggy blonde posing on the wide marble steps, dressed in a silk
gown that clung like a second skin.

Their eyes had met. Alex had grinned and without hesitation
she’d come down the steps, hips swaying thanks to heels so high
they seemed to be made for sin, oblivious to the frenzied ‘Hey!’
of the photographer.
“Hello,” she’d cooed when she had reached him, smiling the
smile that was worth ten thousand dollars an hour to an advertiser.
“I’m free this evening, Your Highness, and I certainly hope
that you are, too.”
He’d said he was leaving for Tokyo but he’d be back in three
days. “Call me,” she’d purred, and he had, first thing this
morning. What man wouldn’t? She was stunning. Sexy as hell.
He knew she’d be in his bed at the apartment he kept in town
before the night ended…
So what?
A crazy thought. But there it was. A gorgeous woman, another
hot liaison and all he could think was, So what? He’d have the
model and, come morning, she’d be looking for a way to turn a
night into an affair.
He’d be looking for a polite way to make it clear he wasn’t
interested.
Lately, ending an affair before it really had time to start had
become a pattern. He liked sex. Liked women. Their feel, their
scent, their company. It was just that he couldn’t seem to concentrate
on any one woman lately. For weeks now, he’d drifted
from one to another.
He knewdamned well there were men who’d find that exciting.
He didn’t.
Not that he believed in long-term affairs. A month. Two.
Three, that was about it and then he’d do the right thing, send an
incredibly expensive gift and move on.
Alex frowned.
The past couple of months, the only part of that familiar plan
he seemed to get right was the part about moving on.
His brothers had noticed. They’d taken to teasing him about
what they called his wanderlust. With the emphasis on ‘lust,’
Sebastian said, while Andreas grinned. Even his sisters got in on
10 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
the act, Lissa long-distance from Paris, Kitty sighing dramatically
and saying, Poor Alex. He just can’t find a woman to love.
Well, no. He wasn’t about to explain the difference between
love and lust to either of them but, of course, love had nothing
to do with it. Why would it? Love was one of those things people
talked about that didn’t really exist.
Myths. Myths as creative as any of the tall tales his long-ago
Greek and Roman ancestors had believed.
What people called ‘love’ was hormonal nonsense—though
he couldn’t call what had drawn his parents together hormonal.
They had come together because it was necessary. Carrying on
a name, a bloodline that had existed for centuries was in the
destiny of royals.
It would surely be the same for Sebastian, heir to the throne,
when the time came. Sebastianwould get to choose his ownwife—
thiswas the twenty-first century, after all—but hewould make that
choice from a carefully vetted list of acceptable young women.
Alex, second in line, would be under somewhat less pressure
but he knew the responsibility of marriage to an appropriate
bride, then children to bear his name, was in his future. It was
all part of his duty to the house of Karedes.
He would demand only that his future wife be attractive.
Beyond that, he had no expectations. Companionship, passion—
those things he would find in a mistress. He would be discreet;
he would never deliberately do anything to insult the woman he
married but a royal wife would understand that her role was to
bear him children.
Neither of them would be foolish enough to look for love.
Discretion in their extra-marital affairs would be enough.
Alex stopped pacing, jammed his hands into his trouser
pockets and stared at the coat of arms on the wall over the
enormous fireplace.
There had been a woman once, years ago. A girl, really. He’d
thought—never mind what he’d thought. What mattered was
what she had thought, that she could use her kisses, her touch,
her soft whispers to bewitch him. He’d been a boy then, led
SANDRA MARTON 11
around by a part of his anatomy that had nothing to do with his
brain, but he’d learned the truth about her in time and had been
wiser for it.
Since then, he had not let a woman lure him into complacency.
Into forgetting that a man always had to look beyond a beautiful
face to see a woman’s true agenda…
Until that night two months ago.
A night when a stranger had stepped into his arms, her face
radiant with seeming innocence. She’d lifted her mouth to his,
parted her lips to the whisper of his breath, the thrust of his
tongue and the world had blurred—until the next morning, when
he’d learned it had all been a lie.
“Prince Alexandros.”
Not just a lie. Alex’s jaw tightened. A scam. A fraud. A
swindle of the first magnitude, and he had fallen for it.
“Sir? The king and queen ask that you join them.”
But she hadn’t gotten away with it. Instead, he’d pretended
he knew nothing of her deception. She had played a part; in the
harsh light of day, it had been his turn to play one, too.
He’d taken her back to bed. Had sex with her again. And that
time, when it was over and she lay sated beneath him, he’d
watched her eyes fill with shock as he told her he knew who she
was, what she was, and promised her that all that would come
of her despicable game was defeat.
Then he’d sent her packing.
The incident had meant so little to him that he could not even
remember her name. Despite her wiles, he’d been the victor.
He’d had hours of sex that had seemed incredible, though he
knew now it had only been, well, sex. And the moment of sweet
revenge that followed had made everything right.
“Your Highness? Their majesties will see you now.”
Or had it?
It wasn’t just women he’d had a lot of these past weeks; it was
everything. He’d put endless miles on the royal private jets with
business trips from his offices in New York and Aristo to
Bermuda. To the Bahamas. To the Virgin Islands, to Florida, to
12 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
Mexico and, most recently, Japan. Successful trips, all of them,
but he’d set one hell of a pace. Meetings by day; by night, the
baccarat tables, high-stakes poker…
And sex.
Was it possible he’d spent the last weeks going from country
to country, bed to bed, trying to wipe away the ugly memories
of a night when he’d come as close as a man could to letting a
woman use him?
“Sir. The king and queen are waiting for you.”
Alex blinked. Galen, his father’s major-domo, stood at stiff
attention before him. From the expression on his face, he’d been
there a while.
“Thank you, Galen. Efcharisto.”
“Are you well, sir?”
“Yes, yes, I’m fine. A little distracted.” Alex forced a grin.
“There’s a lady waiting for me in town.You know how that is.”
Galen permitted himself a small smile. “I am sure the lady is
happy to wait, sir,” he said, and stepped aside with a deep bow
as Alex walked past him into the throne room.
His parents were not alone.
A handful of aides hovered around his father, who was seated
at an antique desk liberally strewn with sheets of paper. His
mother stood on the throne platform, encircled by several of her
ladies-in-waiting who held lengths of silk brocade against her
while a seamstress sat on the floor, pinning and tucking and
doing whatever in heaven’s name women did with all those yards
and yards of fabric.
Alex’s lips twitched.
Despite its elegance, the frescoes, the ceiling painted by a sixteenth-
century master and a wall hung with exquisite Byzantine
icons, right now the room looked more like someone’s slightly
messy sitting room than a place in which the kingdom’s most
formal ceremonies were held.
His father looked up. “There you are,” he said in a tone that
suggested it was he who’d been kept waiting. “Well, what do
you think?”
SANDRA MARTON 13
Alex raised his eyebrows. “About what?”
“About these plans, of course.” Aegeus slapped a hand on the
papers spread over his desk. “Do wewant a theme, or do we not?”
No, Alex thought, this was not someone’s sitting room, this
was more like the Mad Hatter’s tea party.
“A theme for what?” he said carefully.
Aegeus shot to his feet, scattering the aides crowded around him.
“For your mother’s sixtieth birthday celebration, of course!
If you hadn’t spent the last month doing God knows what, you’d
know what was going on here!”
“Now, Aegeus.” Husband and son looked at the queen, who
smiled at them both. “You know Alexandros has been busy convincing
foreigners that our kingdom is the perfect place for them
to invest in the future. And I’m sure we can assume he’s been
successful. Haven’t you, Alex?”
Alex smiled and went to his mother. She bent toward him and
he took her hand and brought it to his lips.
“Mother. I’ve missed you.”
“How was your trip?”
“It was fine.” Alex smiled. “We snared a lot of foreigners who
look forward to a happy future.”
His mother laughed. “You see, Aegeus? It’s just as I said.” Tia
waved the women away and came gracefully down the steps. “It’s
good to have you home again, Alexandros.”
“It’s good to be here.” Alex nodded at the women gathering
up the fabrics. “What’s all this?”
“I just told you what it is,” Aegeus said with impatience.
“Preparation for your mother’s birthday celebration. I thought we
should make the final selections of décor, color and fabric here
in the throne room, where the most formal part of the ceremony
will take place. Isn’t that right, gentlemen?”
The aides nodded.
“We want to be certain everything comes together properly.”
Aegeus looked at his aides, who nodded again. Alex thought
of turkeys pecking for grain at the feet of the farmer who owned
them and repressed a smile.
14 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
“So, what do you think, Alexandros? What theme shall we
use? Our history as part of the ancient world? A link to the days
of the Crusades? The time of the Ottoman Empire? All those
things, as you well know, are in our bloodline.”
Who gave a damn? What mattered was the celebration of his
mother’s sixtieth birthday, not his father’s lineage.
“Any of those would be fine,” Alex said smoothly, with a
quick glance at his mother. “Something big and splashy. After
all, we don’t want it said that only the Calistans can do parties
that are showy.”
He saw his mother bite back a smile.Any mention of Calista,
which had once been part of the Adamas empire along with
Aristo, was enough to make his father’s hackles rise.
“Showy,” Aegeus said, frowning.
“Exactly.” Alex shook his head. “I’ve never understood why
there was so much coverage of the Queen of England’s birthday
celebration a couple of years ago when it was all so low-key.
Have you, Mother?”
“No,” Tia said with perfect innocence, “I’ve never understood
it, either. All those reporters and television people, theworldwide
interest in Elizabeth and the British royals…and all of it done,
as you say, Alexandros, with such quiet elegance.”
The king snorted. “What is there to understand? One either
knows the virtue of simplicity or one doesn’t.” He looked down
at the papers on his desk, studied them for a long moment, then
swept them to the floor with his hand. “I have just chosen a theme
for your birthday celebration, Tia. The coming of spring. I can
envision it now. Masses of early spring flowers. The Venetian
dinnerware in shades of palest green and yellow. And you, the
queen, dressed in a gown the same pale pink as the diamond in
the Aristan crown.”
Thank you, Tia mouthed to her son. Alex flashed her a grin.
“That sounds very nice,” she said demurely.
“Nice? It will be magnificent, especially with you resplendent
in the new necklace I’ll commission as your birthday gift.
Although we could add a brooch…”
SANDRA MARTON 15
“No brooch,” the queen said. “It would be inappropriate,
Aegeus, to wear both a brooch and a necklace.”
The king waved his hand. “Whatever. Take it up with the
craftsman.”
“The jewelry designer,” Tia commented. “That’s what she is.”
She? Alex frowned and thought back to the weekend the final
half-dozen jewelry designers, selected from all around the globe,
had been invited to Aristo to meet with his parents. Had there been
another woman in the group? He only recalled one.
But then, he thought grimly, that had been the plan, hadn’t it?
That the prince who might influence the choice of designer
should have been so bewitched he would notice only one?
Besides, what did his father mean by talking about the
necklace he would commission? The commission had been made
weeks before.
“—don’t you agree, Alexandros?”
Alex looked at his father. “Sorry, Father. I missed that.”
“I said, it doesn’t matter what this woman is called. Designer,
artisan, craftsman—craftswoman,” the king amended, with a nod
to his wife. “She simply must understand the importance of this
commission… And why are all the rest of you still hanging
about?” Aegeus clapped his hands and the seamstress, aides and
ladies-in-waiting scurried from the room. “She must understand
that, Tia. That is a given.”
The queen nodded. “I am certain that she will.”
“I hope you’re right. She seemed very young to me.”
Things were becoming more confusing. His parents were
definitely referring to a woman designer. A young designer…
Alex stiffened.
No. They couldn’t be talking about her. About Maria Santos
and, yes, he damned well did remember her name. How could
he not? A man who was marked to be the gullible victim of a
scam didn’t forget the person who’d been the scammer.
“She couldn’t have seemed anything to you, Aegeus,” Tia
said, with a little smile. “Remember? We never had the pleasure
of meeting her. She sent us a note and explained she’d been
16 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
taken ill that morning. But, of course, we already had seen Miss
Santos’s sketches, and—”
A fist seemed to clench Alex’s gut. He took a deep breath and
forced himself to speak calmly. “Maria Santos? But you said the
commission went to a French company.”
“It did, but they just notified us that the owner passed away
and left the firm tied up in all kinds of unpleasant litigation.” Tia
took Alex’s arm. “I know. It’s all very last minute, and Miss
Santos doesn’t even know that we’re going to ask her to implement
her design.”
“That’s why your trip to New York has such urgency,
Alexandros.”
Alex stared at his father. “What trip to New York?”
“You will see the Santoswoman and inform her of our decision.”
“What your father means,” Queen Tia said, “is that you’ll
explain what’s happened and ask Miss Santos if she will be
generous enough to take on the job at such short notice.”
Another snort from the king. “She’ll leap at the chance.”
“But she might not,” the queen said softly. “This is very last
minute. And true artists have tender egos. Miss Santos may not
like thinking of herself as second choice.”
Alex wanted to laugh. A tender ego? He’d bet Maria Santos
had an ego that could dent cast iron.
“You’re the diplomat in the family,” the king said briskly.
“All that talking and contracting with the businesses you’ve lured
to our island over the years…”
It was as close to a compliment as his father had ever offered
but it wasn’t enough to make Alex go to Maria Santos and present
her with the chance of a lifetime.
“Iwould be happy to help,”Alex said briskly, “but I have pressing
commitments here on the island. Surely someone else can—”
“Someone else cannot,” Aegeus retorted. “You have offices
and an apartment in New York. You know the city. You know its
tempo, its attitude. You’ll be better able to work with the Santos
woman and ensure the necklace is ready in time.”
So much for compliments. This was a royal command. That
SANDRA MARTON 17
the woman who’d wanted this job badly enough to damned near
sell herself to secure it would now get it by default, that he would
be the man who’d have to offer it to her, was almost too ironic
to believe.
“There were other designs submitted,” he said. “Surely one
of them would do?”
His mother’s small hand tightened on his arm. “I preferred
Miss Santos’s work from the beginning, Alex. I deferred to your
father when he selected the French firm, of course, but now…”
Alex looked at the queen as her words trailed away. He knew
it would take little for his father to tell her he had decided on a
different designer. Tia was as restrained as Aegeus was quicktempered,
as gentle as the king was stern. He’d always had the
feeling his mother’s life was not quite the life she had hoped for.
Growing up, he’d spent little time at her side. Boarding school,
tutors, the expected rigor of life as a king’s son had seen to that,
but he loved her deeply none the less. And if a birthday gift
designed by Maria Santos was what she wanted…
“Alexandros?” Tia said softly. “Do you think I’m making
a mistake?”
Alex put his arm around his mother’s shoulders and hugged her.
“What I think is that you should have precisely what you
want on your birthday.”
His mother beamed. “Thank you.”
“Thank me, you mean,” the king said briskly, and gave his
wife what passed for a loving smile. “I’m the one commissioning
your gift.”
The queen laughed. She rose on her toes and kissed her son’s
cheek, then reached for her husband’s hand.
“Thank you both,” she said. “How’s that?”
“It’s fine,” Alex replied.
And that was what he kept telling himself, that it would be
fine, during the seemingly endless flight all the way from Aristo
to New York.
CHAPTER TWO
EVERYTHING was going to be fine.
Absolutely fine, Maria told herself wearily as the Lexington
Avenue local rumbled to a stop at the Spring Street subway station.
Never mind that the man next to her smelled like a skillet of
sautéing garlic. Forget that her feet were shrieking after a day
strapped into gorgeous-but-impossible Manolo stilettos. Pretend
the rain that had become sleet hadn’t turned her sleek, three
hundred dollar Chez Panache blow-out right back into her usual
tumble of coffee-colored wild curls, or that she was obviously
coming down with the flu or something suspiciously like it.
Oh, yes, everything was going to be fine.
And if it wasn’t…if it wasn’t…
The train gave a lurch as it left the station. Garlic Man fell
into her, Maria stumbled sideways and felt one of her sky-high
heels give way.
A word sprang to her lips. It was a word ladies didn’t use, even
if they knew how to say it in Spanish as well as English. Not that
Maria felt much like a lady right now. Still, she bit back the word,
instead visualized it in big neon letters and decided that trying
to figure a way to find the lost heel on the floor of the packed
subway car was something only a madwoman would attempt.
Goodbye, Manolo Blahniks. Goodbye, Chez Panache.
Goodbye, Jewels by Maria.
No. Absolutely, no. She was not going to think like that. What
was it she’d learned in that stress reduction class? Okay, she
hadn’t taken the class, not exactly; there was no time for anything
like taking classes in her life but she’d read the course description
in The New School catalog…
Live in the now.
That was it. Reduce stress by learning to live in the now. At
the moment, that meant—damn!—that meant the train was
pulling into Canal Street.
“Excuse me. Sorry. Coming through!”
She pushed her way through the rush-hour crowd, reached the
doors just as they began to shut and hurled herself onto the
platform. The doors closed; the train started. People surged
toward the stairs, carrying a hobbling Maria in their midst.
Climbing the steps to the street with one shoe now four inches
shorter than the other was an interesting experience. Why did
they make shoes with heels like these? Better still, why had she
bought them? Because men thought they looked good? Well, they
did, but that wasn’t the reason. There was no man in her life; she
couldn’t imagine there would be, not for a long time after that
incident two months ago on Aristo.
The prince. The prince of darkness, was how she’d taken to
thinking of him, and she felt the anger rise inside her again.
Damn it, why was she remembering him, anyway? Why waste
time on him or that night? It had all been a nightmare. She hated
herself for it, would probably always hate herself for it, thought
not half as much as she hated him and…
And, there was no point in this.
Aristo, the commission she’dwanted so much and lost because
of him, were behind her. She had to concentrate on the present.
On how to convince shops like L’Orangerie to buy her designs.
That, she thought grimly, that was why she’d worn these
shoes.Why she’d spent as much on a stupid blow-out as she could
have spent to buy gold wire for the new earrings she’d been
sketching.Why she’d all but begged for today’s meeting with the
buyer from L’Orangerie. And where had it gotten her?
Nowhere, Maria thought as she reached the sidewalk. Nowhere
SANDRA MARTON 19
20 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
except out here, limping home like a derelict in sleet that was
rapidly turning to snow.
The weather, coupled with the fact that it was Friday, had sent
people fleeing their offices earlier than usual. Still, the street was
crowded. This was Manhattan, after all. The good news was that
because this was Manhattan, nobody so much as looked at her.
Still, she felt ridiculous, hobbling like this.
Yes, Maria, but the better news is that your heel could have
come off when you were on Fifth Avenue, heading for that
meeting with the man from L’Orangerie.
What an impression she’d have made then.
Not that it would have mattered.
L’Orangerie’s head buyer had been polite enough to keep the
lunch appointment and honest enough to begin it by telling her
he wasn’t going to buy her designs.
“I like them, Ms. Santos,” he’d said, “I like them very much—
but your name will mean nothing to our clients. Perhaps after
you’ve had a bit more exposure…?”
More exposure? Maria gave an inelegant snort as she turned
the corner. How much more exposure did she need? After
winning the Caligari prize, she’d sold to Tiffany’s. To Harry
Winston. To Barney’s.
She’d said all that to her luncheon companion. And he had
said yes, he knew she had, but her status in those places was insignificant
compared to designers like Paloma Picasso and Elsa
Peretti, n’est-ce pas?
Not, she’d wanted to say. Not n’est-ce pas.
Maybe she didn’t have a lot of pieces in the display cases.
Maybe the stores didn’t buy whole page ads for her in The New
York Times and the high fashion magazines. Okay, maybe they
didn’t advertise her name at all.
But she’d sold to the big players. That mattered. And the
pieces she’d designed were certainly more significant than that
phony French accent laid over the unmistakable underpinnings
of his Brooklyn upbringing.
She almost told him so.
SANDRA MARTON 21
Fortunately, sanity had made her put a forkful of salad instead
of her foot in her mouth.
She couldn’t afford to insult a jewelry buyer of such influence.
The world to which she wanted entry was small.
Gossipy. Insulting one of its door-keepers came under the
heading of ShootingYourself in the Head Just to See if the Gun
Would Fire.
Besides, he was right.
She’d been incredibly lucky to sell a few pieces to those
stores. Who knew if she’d ever sell them others? Who knew how
she’d sell them others? Not landing the Aristan commission had
been an enormous setback.
When you could add a discreet line to your business card that
said ‘By commission to Their Majesties, King Aegeus and Queen
Tia of Aristo,’ you had the world by the tail.
She’d lost the chance to have that happen.
Correction. A man had taken that chance from her. A man who
had seduced her and then tossed her out of his bed as if she’d
been a twenty-dollar whore.
“Stop that,” she muttered to herself. Why think of him now?
Why waste time looking back? There was no point.
Maria made a left on Broome Street, hobbled to the next
corner, turned down that street and, finally, there it was. Her
building. Well, not hers. The building in which she lived. And
worked. That was the great thing about renting a loft. There was
plenty of space within its high walls, room for sleeping and
eating, but mostly room for working.
If she could keep working.
The fact of the matter was, she was in debt up to her ears.
The loft cost thousands a month to rent. The gold and silver,
the precious and semi-precious stones with which she worked,
cost thousands, too. She had only one employee, Joaquin, but she
had to meet his salary every week. And designing something that
would be a fit gift for the Queen of Aristo’s sixtieth birthday had
taken hours and hours of time.
So she’d borrowed the small fortune she’d needed to pay her
22 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
rent, her bills, to set aside other projects and devote endless
hours to a design for the competition.
Useless, all of it. Useless.
She had been one of the three finalists. They’d all been invited
to Aristo, where the winner would be announced at a ceremony.
And she’d lost any possibility of being that winner in one night.
One foolish night.
A handful of hours had ruined her hopes and dreams, had left
her humiliated beyond measure and the truth was, it was her fault,
all of it. Not the fault of the man who’d seduced her.
Alexandros, the Prince of Aristo, had only proved what she
already knew. The hell with soft lights and sweet talk. All a man
wanted from a woman was sex. That she, of all women, should
have forgotten that cold truth and given in to a moment’s
weakness, was unforgivable.
Once you’d warmed a man’s bed, he had no further use for
you. If something unexpected happened, like, in this case, it
turning out that he was an Aristan prince and you were a finalist
in the competition to design his mother’s birthday gift, he’d lay
the blame for the seduction on you, even when he was the one
who’d done the seducing.
Her father had put the blame on her mother.
The mighty prince had put the blame on her.
“Damn this useless shoe,” Maria said furiously. To hell with
the snow and the icy pavement. She bent down, ripped off both
the broken shoe and its mate, and strode the last few wet yards
to her front door.
It swung open just as she reached it. Joaquin stepped onto the
street, smiled when he saw her but his smile changed to bewilderment
as his startled gaze dropped to her nylon-clad feet.
“Maria? ¿Cuál es la materia? ¿Por qué está usted descalzo
en este tiempo?”
Maria forced a smile. “Nothing’s wrong. I broke my heel,
that’s all.” She stepped past him into the vestibule. “I thought
you’d be gone by now.”
The door swung shut behind her. She started up the stairs to
SANDRA MARTON 23
the loft, Joaquin at her heels. There was a freight elevator, but,
as usual, it wasn’t working.
“I am still here, as you can see. I waited in hopes you would
return to tell me good news.”
Maria nodded but said nothing. When they reached the third
floor, she stabbed her key into the lock, walked briskly across
the age-dulled hardwood floor, dropped her shoes and bag on a
table near one of the loft’s big windows and turned toward her
old friend and co-worker.
“That was good of you.”
Joaquin’s warm brown eyes searched her face. “It did not go
well?”
Maria sighed as she slipped her coat from her shoulders. She
could lie or at least make the meeting with the buyer sound more
hopeful, but there was no point. Joaquin knew her too well. He’d
been working for her for five years. More than that, they’d grown
up in neighboring apartments in a crumbling building in the
Bronx, which was not a place most people thought of when they
spoke of New York.
Joaquin and his family had come from Puerto Rico to the
mainland when he was five and she was six. He was the brother
she’d never had.
So, no. Trying to fool him was useless.
“Maria?” he said softly, and she sighed.
“We didn’t get the contract.”
His expression softened. “Ah. I am so sorry. What happened?
I thought this Frenchman had good taste.”
“He’s not even a Frenchman,” Maria said with a little laugh.
“As for taste, well, he says he likes my work. But—”
“But?”
“But, I should get in touch with him when Jewels by Maria
is better known.”
“When it is,” Joaquin said stoutly, “you won’t need him.”
Maria grinned. “It’s just a good thing you’re married or I’d
nab you for myself.”
Joaquin grinned, too. It was an old joke and they both knew
24 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
it had no meaning. So did Joaquin’s wife, who was Maria’s
best friend.
“I’ll be sure and tell Sela you said that.”
“Tell her, too, that I’m looking forward to dinner on Sunday.”
“I will.” Joaquin tucked his hands in his overcoat pockets. “I
left the new wax castings on the workbench.”
“Thank you.”
“FedEx delivered the opals you ordered. I put them in the safe.”
“Excellent.”
Joaquin hesitated. “There is also a letter—a registered letter—
from the bank.”
“Of course there is,” Maria said sharply. She sighed and put
her hand lightly on Joaquin’s arm in apology. “Sorry.” She
smiled. “No need to kill the messenger, right?”
“You might change your mind when I tell you that your
mother phoned.”
Joaquin said it lightly but they both knew a call from Luz
Santos was rarely pleasant. Maria’s mother’s life had not gone
well; she held her daughter responsible. Having Maria had
changed her life. It had ended her dreams. Her plans. Not that she
had regrets. Oh, no. No regrets. She had sacrificed everything for
Maria but that was what mothers were supposed to do.
If only Maria would make the sacrifice worthwhile. If only
she would stop playing with trinkets and get a real job…
“My mother,” Maria said, and sighed again. “Did she say
what she wanted?”
“Her back is acting up. She has indigestion. Her doctor is of
no use to her.” Joaquin cleared his throat. “Mrs. Ferrara’s
daughter was just promoted.”
Maria nodded. “Of course.”
“So was your cousin Angela.”
“Again,” Maria said, deadpan.
“Again,” Joaquin agreed.
Suddenly, it seemed too much. The day. The disappointment.
The overdue bank loan. The flu symptoms she couldn’t shake,
and now a call from Mama… A little moan escaped her lips.
SANDRA MARTON 25
Joaquin put his arms around her and she gave in and leaned her
head against his shoulder.
“Maria, I have a fine idea. Come with me. You know Sela will
be thrilled to see you. She is making Chile Colorado for supper.
When was the last time you had something so delicious, hmm?”
She smiled, stood straight and knotted the woolen scarf at his
neck.
“Joaquin,” she said gently, “go home.”
“If there was a way Sela and I could help you—”
“I know.”
“If only you had gotten that commission. I still cannot understand
the reason you didn’t win.”
She understood it, but she’d sooner have died than divulge it.
“You’ll see, Joaquin. Everything will work out.”
“De su boca al oído del Dios.”
From her mouth to God’s ear. It made her smile again. She
clasped his face in her hands and kissed him lightly on the mouth.
“Go home, mi amigo.”
“Sela will be angry I left you alone at a time like this.”
“Tell Sela I love her but I am your boss,” Maria said with mock
severity, “and I sent you home.”
Joaquin grinned. “Yes, boss,” he said, and pressed a kiss to
her forehead.
She watched as he made his way to the door. It swung shut
after him and she wrapped her arms around herself and shuddered.
It was very cold in the loft. The high ceiling seemed to
steal the landlord’s miserly allotment of heat from the radiators
and the windows, though wonderfully big, were as old as the
building. On a day like this, the wind was relentless and sent
chilly air straight into the cavernous room.
A draft was blowing right on her. And a film of frost was just
beginning to form on the glass. Maria rubbed at it with her fist…
What was that car doing here?
It was parked just across the street. A big car, long and black
and elegant. She knew little about automobiles but in this stillungentrified
stretch of Lower Manhattan a Rolls or a Mercedes
26 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
or a Bentley, whatever the vehicle was, stood out like the proverbial
sore thumb.
Her lips turned down.
It was probably a realtor, trying to get a feel for things. They’d
been showing up as regularly as rats in the alley, a sure sign that
the area was about to become too expensive for people like her.
One realtor had even turned up at her door a couple of weeks ago,
oozing charm. She’d only managed to get rid of him by assuring
him she didn’t own her loft—though she hadn’t been able to keep
from telling him that if she did, there wasn’t a way in the world
she’d sell it to him.
In a gesture of defiance and frustration, she glared at the car
and stuck out her tongue. Then she drew back into the darkness,
laughing nervously at herself. What a crazy thing to do but on a
day that had gone as badly as this, it was better than nothing.
Alex, sitting in the back of the Bentley limo, blinked in surprise.
Had the Santos woman just stuck her tongue out at him?
No. Why would she do that? She couldn’t even see him. It was
dark. The windows of the car were tinted. She had no way of
knowing if there was someone in the car or not.
A distortion, then, caused by the cold and the heavily
falling snow.
Not that it had been falling heavily enough to have kept him
from seeing that cozy lovers’ greeting between her and the man
who’d just left. And not that he gave a damn. Five minutes to
explain why he was here, that the commission was hers, and that
would be the end of it.
This was for his mother. He could ignore his anger. His
disgust. He could do this.
He just wished he hadn’t had to view such a charming little
scene. It was enough to make his belly knot. A snowy evening.
A lover, so eager for his woman that he met her downstairs.
Greeted her with tenderness. Went back upstairs with her. Talked
to her. Kissed her…
And walked away.
SANDRA MARTON 27
Alex frowned.
What sort of lover was this man? Why had he chosen the cold
night instead of a woman’s heat? As for tenderness… Did he not
know that tenderness was not what Maria Santos wanted? She
was hot. Wild. Eager in bed.
Even now, he could remember how she had been that night.
Her scent. Lilies of the valley, he had thought, as delicate and
fragrant as those that grew wild in the hills near his home on the
cliffs. Her skin, warm and soft under his questing hands. Her hair,
brushing like silk against his throat.
Her nipples, sweet on his tongue.
Her mouth hot, so hot against his.
Her little cries. Her moans. That one incredible moment as
he’d entered her when he’d thought—when he’d imagined—
that she had never before known a man’s possession.
And, damn it, what in hell was he doing? His body had grown
hard, just remembering. Alex let down the window and drew a
long breath of cold, snow-laden air into his lungs.
The thing to remember was not how she had been in his bed
but the reason she had been there. It had not been an accident;
that she’d stood in seeming uncertainty just in front of the
building in which he had his offices in Ellos, guidebook in hand,
had been, he knew, deliberate.
He had not suspected it then.
But he’d noticed her right away. What man wouldn’t?
Slender, very pretty, her dark mane of hair pulled away from
her face by a simple gold clasp and left to tumble down her
back, her figure limned by the fading light of the day, she’d been
a delightful sight.
He’d paused as he came out the door. She had a pair of small
reading glasses perched on the end of her nose; somehow, that
had added to her charm.
American, he’d thought, a tourist. And, without question, lost.
He’d been in no particular hurry to go anywhere. Okay, why
not? he’d said to himself, and smiled as he’d approached her.
“Excuse me,” he’d said pleasantly, “but do you need some help?”
28 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
She’d looked up from the slim guidebook, her eyes a little blurry
because of the glasses. Her hesitation had been artful, just enough
to make her seem not just cautious but almost old-fashioned.
“Well—well—thank you. Yes, actually, I do. If you could tell
me… I’m looking for the Argus. It’s a restaurant. Well, a café.
The guidebook says it’s supposed to be right here. The hotel desk
clerk said so, too. But—”
“But it isn’t,” Alex had said, smiling again. “And, I’m afraid,
it hasn’t been, not for at least a year.”
Her face had fallen. Disappointment had only made her lovelier.
“Oh. Oh, I see. Well—thank you again.”
“You’re most welcome.”
She’d taken off her glasses and gone on looking up at him,
her eyes—hazel, he’d noted, neither brown nor green nor gold
but a veritable swirl of colors—as wide and innocent as a fawn’s.
Innocent as a fox approaching a hen house, he thought now,
his mouth thinning to a tight line.
Maria Santos had known exactly what she was doing, right up
to howshe’d reacted when he’d suggested another restaurant nearby.
“Is it…?” She’d hesitated. “I mean, is this other restaurant—?”
“As good as the Argus?” Truth was, he had no idea. He’d never
been to the Argus. From what little he recalled, it had been a tiny
café, just a place to get a quick bite.
“As inexpensive.” Color had swept into her cheeks. “The
guidebook says—”
“You don’t have to worry about that,” he’d said, because
she wouldn’t.
The restaurant he’d recommended was incredibly expensive—
but he would take her to it. He would dine with her and
pay the bill. Just to talk, he’d told himself. Just to be a good ambassador
for his country, even though—to his surprise—this
beautiful stranger did not seem to recognize his face when the
simple truth, much to his chagrin, was that spotting him was as
much a tourist attraction as the beaches, the yachts and the casino.
The hell she hadn’t recognized him.
She’d known who he was. She’d set the entire thing up.
SANDRA MARTON 29
But he had not known it, then.
She’d protested prettily that she couldn’t possibly let him pay
for her meal but she’d let him think he’d overcome her protests.
And, after dinner, when they’d walked along the sea wall, when
he’d kissed her while they stood surrounded by the tall pines that
grew on a little promontory and their kisses had gone from soft
and exploratory to hot and deep, when his hands had gone under
her silk skirt and she’d moaned into his mouth, when he’d put his
arm tightly around herwaist, still kissing her, and led her through
the now-quiet streets to his flat, to his bed, when she’d clung to
him and whispered she’d never done anything like this before…
When she’d come apart in his arms, her cries so sweet, so
wild, so real…
Alex cursed.
“Sir?” his driver said, but Alex ignored him, swung open the
door of the Bentley himself and stepped into the night.
Lies, all of it, lies that had come undone in the early morning
when he’d reached for her again and found her side of the bed
empty. He’d assumed she was in the bathroom.
She wasn’t.
He’d heard her voice, soft as the breeze from the sea. Was she
on the phone? Without knowing why he did it, he’d carefully
lifted the one on his night table and brought it to his ear.
Yes, he’d heard her say with a breathy little laugh, yes,
Joaquin, I think I really do have a good chance of being named
the winner. I know the competition is tough but I have every
reason to believe my chances are really excellent.
She’d looked up from the telephone when he walked into the
kitchen. Her face had gone crimson.
“You’re awake,” she’d begun to say, with an awkward smile.
He’d taken the phone from her hand. Pressed the ‘end’button.
Carried her back to bed without saying a word, taken her in
passion born of anger.
Then he’d told her to get her clothes on. To get the hell out.
And not to bother showing up at the palace, later.
“Your chances of being named to design my mother’s
30 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
birthday gift,” he’d said in clipped tones, “are less than those
of a snowball in hell.”
Alex strode across the street.
It had taken two months but that prediction was no longer just
a metaphor. Here was the snow. And, in just a couple of minutes,
Maria Santos would get a first-hand introduction to hell.
And he would get the satisfaction of putting her, and that
night, out of his head.
Forever.
CHAPTER THREE
MARIA sighed, peeled off her dressed-for-success suit jacket,
tossed it over the back of a chair and automatically reached for
the phone to return her mother’s call.
Her hand stilled.
What was she doing? A ten-minute litany of aches and pains,
followed by a lecture about how she needed to get a real job, were
the last things she wanted right now.
Get out of her clothes. Run a hot bath. Eat something. Then
she’d make the call.
Maria looked at her shoes, made a face and heaved them into
the big trash can beside her work table. Gorgeous but impractical.
She should have known better than to have bought them.
Gorgeous but impractical was not for her. It never had been.
And she hadn’t bought the shoes for today, she’d bought them
for the weekend she’d gone to Aristo. She’d wanted to look sophisticated,
but the shoes hadn’t done her much good then, either.
Even if she’d looked sophisticated, she’d behaved like a—likea—
No. She wasn’t going there. Not tonight. Rejected by a phony
Frenchman today, rejected by an arrogantAristan two months ago.
That was more than enough.
She stepped out of her skirt and padded, barefoot, to the end
of the loft that served as a sleeping area. She tossed the skirt on
the futon, peeled off her bra and pantyhose, yanked the clasp
from her hair, bent forward and ran her hands briskly through
32 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
the now-wildly curling strands. Then she tossed her head back,
grabbed a pair of old, scruffy sweats, and put them on.
Time for supper, though the thought of eating made her feel
vaguely queasy.
Nothing new in that. On top of everything else, she’d felt
vaguely ill for the past week or so. No big surprise, considering
that half the city was down with the flu. She probably had it, too,
but she couldn’t afford to give in to it right now, not with half a
dozen pieces to complete by the end of the month.
Her buyers expected her to be prompt. And she needed the
money they’d owe her on delivery.
So, no, she wouldn’t even admit to the possibility that she
might be sick. Absolutely not. She was under stress, she was
working hard. The fatigue, the heaviness in her limbs, the faint
sense of nausea that came and went…
Stress, was what it was.
Something to eat, something bland, would make her feel
better. Nerves had made her bypass breakfast; lunch had been a
joke. Definitely, she had to put something in her stomach.
Soup? Scrambled eggs? Grilled cheese? Better still, she could
order in from Lo Ming’s, down on the corner. Egg drop soup.
Steamed dumplings. Forget the calories. Forget the cost. An
order of Chinese comfort food, then she’d turn on the TV, curl
up on the sofa, get lost in something mindless while—
The doorbell rang.
Now what? It was late. Who would come here at this hour?
Of course. Joaquin. He knew what a setback today had been.
He’d probably gone half a block, phoned Sela on his cell phone
and she’d ordered him to go back and insist Maria come for supper.
The bell rang again. Maria pinned a smile to her lips, went to
the heavy door, undid the lock and pulled it open.
“Joaquin,” she said, “honestly, you have to learn to take ‘no’
for an ans…”
Alexandros Karedes, snow dusting the shoulders of his leather
jacket and glittering like jewels in his dark hair, stood at the door.
Maria felt the blood drain from her head.
SANDRA MARTON 33
“Good evening, Ms. Santos.”
His voice was as she remembered it. Deep. Husky. Perfect
English, but with the faintest hint of a Greek accent. And cold, as
cold as it had been that awful morning shewould never forget, when
he’d accused her of horrible things, called her terrible names…
“Aren’t you going to ask me in?”
She fought for composure. Last time they’d faced each other,
they’d been on his turf. Now they were on hers. She was in
command here, and that meant everything.
“There’s a sign on the door downstairs,” she said, her tone
every bit as frigid as his. “It says, ‘No soliciting or vagrants.’”
His lips drew back in a wolfish grin. “Very amusing.”
“What do you want, Prince Alexandros?”
Atight smile eased across his mouth and it killed her that even
now, knowing he was a vicious, arrogant man, she couldn’t help
but notice what a handsome mouth it was. Chiseled. Generous.
Beautiful, like the rest of him, which made him living proof that
beauty could, indeed, be only skin deep.
“Such formality, Maria. You were hardly so proper the last
time we were together.”
She knew his choice of words was deliberate. She felt her face
heat; she couldn’t help that but she damned well didn’t have to
let him lure her into a verbal sparring match.
“I’ll ask you once more,Your Highness. What do you want?”
“Ask me in and I’ll tell you.”
“I have no intention of asking you in. Tell me why you’re here
or don’t. It’s your choice, just as it will be my choice to shut the
door in your face.”
He laughed. It infuriated her but she could hardly blame him.
He was tall—six two, six three—and though he stood with one
shoulder leaning against the door frame, hands tucked casually
into the pockets of the jacket, his pose was deceptive. He was
strong, with the leanly muscled body of a well-trained athlete.
She remembered his body with painful clarity. The feel of him
under her hands. The power of him moving over her. The taste
of him on her tongue.
34 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
Suddenly, he straightened, his laughter gone. “I have not come
this distance to stand in your doorway,” he said coldly, “and I am
not going to leave until I am ready to do so. I suggest you stand
aside and stop behaving like a petulant child.”
A petulant child? Was that what he thought? This man who
had spent hours making love to her and had then accused her of—
of trading her body for profit?
Except, it had not been love, it had been sex. And the sooner
she got rid of him, the better.
She let go of the door knob and stepped aside. “You have
five minutes.”
He strolled past her, bringing cold air and the scent of the night
with him. She swung toward him, arms folded. He reached past
her, pushed the door closed, then folded his arms, too. She
wanted to open the door again but she’d be damned if she was
going to get into a who’s-in-charge-here argument with him.
She was in charge, and he would surely see a tussle over the
ground rules as a sign of weakness.
Instead, she looked past him at the big clock above her
work table.
“Ten seconds gone,” she said briskly. “You’re wasting time,
Your Highness.”
“What I have to say will take longer than five minutes.”
“Then you’ll just have to learn to economize. More than five
minutes, I’ll call the police.”
Instantly, his hand was wrapped around her wrist. He tugged
her toward him, his dark chocolate eyes almost black with anger.
“You do that.And I’ll tell every tabloid shark I can contact about
howMaria Santos tried to buy a five-hundred-thousand-dollar commission
by seducing a prince.” He smiled thinly. “They’ll lap it up.”
She blanched, but she kept her chin up and her eyes on his.
“Don’t try to scare me with lies! You can’t afford that kind
of gossip.”
“I’ve learned to endure that kind of gossip, Ms. Santos. It’s
part of my life. Besides, I’m the righteous prince who discovered
what you wanted and tossed you out on your backside.” Another
SANDRA MARTON 35
of those cold smiles twisted his lips. “They’ll eat you alive. How
do you think that will go over with the handful of reputable
clients you’ve somehow managed to snare?”
Maria yanked her hand free. “!Usted es un cochon!” she
hissed. “!Un cochon malnacido!”
“I think not. If I truly were an ill-bred pig, I would have told
you exactly what I thought of you eight weeks ago instead of just
throwing you out of my apartment.”
Color rushed to her cheeks. She hadn’t figured he understood
Spanish but, then, she’d been wrong in every judgment she’d
made about this man from the start.
“You did tell me,” she snapped, “and now it’s my pleasure to
return the favor.You’re down to four minutes before I call the cops.
Dealing with the media will beworth it, if I can just get rid of you.”
“What’s the problem, Maria? Expecting your lover to return?”
“What?”
“Your lover. What did you call him that morning? Joaquin?”
Joaquin. The idea was so ludicrous she almost laughed, but
laughter would take more energy than she could spare. Besides,
she didn’t have to explain anything.
“Joaquin is none of your business.”
“You’re right, of course.” Alex strolled across the room to the
front windowand peered out at his limo,waiting at the curb across
the street. “But I had a front-row seat for your little welcome
home this evening.You can’t blame me for being curious.”
Maria rushed to the window. A front-row seat? Impossible.
The Prince of Arrogance would surely not have stood in the cold
and the snow, watching her window…
The big car. It was his. Furious, she swung toward her unwelcome
guest.
“You were sitting out there, spying on me?”
“You might want to consider curtains,” he said with lazy
self-assurance.
“You—you…” She pointed a finger at the door. “Get out
of my home!”
Alex didn’t move. Instead, he tucked his hands in the slash
36 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
pockets of his jacket and gave her a long look, starting at her feet
and working slowly up to her face. She certainly wasn’t dressed
like a woman waiting for her lover to come back. Not in a pair
of baggy sweats that had seen better days. There was a hole in
one knee, what looked like a burn in the shirt just below her collarbone.
Her feet were bare, her hair a wild mass of curls.
His belly knotted.
Her hair had been like that the last time he’d seen her, a tumble
of long, glorious curls falling around her heart-shaped face. She’d
been wearing his robe; she’d been lost in it and somehowthat had
made her look even sexier, maybe because he’d known, intimately,
what was beneath that robe. The delicate, golden-hued
skin. The small, uptilted breasts. The slim curve of her waist, the
surprisingly feminine richness of her hips.
Her face had been sexy, too. Glowing eyes. Dewy skin. No
make-up, not even lipstick, though her mouth had been rosy and
softly swollen from his kisses.
She had looked—what did the French call it? Déshabillé. As
if she had just come from bed.
Which she had. His bed. His bed and his possession, and that
memory was enough to do more than make his belly knot. It sent
a bolt of pure lust straight to his loins.
He still wanted her.
It had taken the sight of her in a scruffy sweatshirt and
baggy sweatpants before he’d permitted himself to admit it.
What man wanted to acknowledge he still desired a woman
who’d tried to use him?
One who was a fool, he told himself. And then he thought,
no. Hell, no. That wasn’t it at all. Maria Santos owed him and
that was her fault, not his. She had lured him into bed. Seduced
him, though he’d thought he was the one doing the seducing.
She’d plotted everything, from that supposedly accidental
meeting on the street to the moment he’d first kissed her. The
only thing surprising about that night was that she’d been able
to keep from smirking triumphantly when he’d asked her to
come home with him.
SANDRA MARTON 37
She’d made a fool of him, and she still owed him for that.
Owed him big time, as the Americans said. And until that
debt was paid, the memory of his humiliation would continue
to haunt him.
He had no doubt what it would take to expunge that memory.
Her, in his bed again. Moving beneath him. Coming on a
long, explosive cry as he watched her with clinical detachment.
There’d be no phony little cries. No subterfuge. He would make
her want him, make her react to him.
And then he’d send her packing for the second, and last, time.
“Your five minutes are up, Prince Alexandros.”
Alex looked at her. Her expression, her body language, were
defiant. She thought she was in charge.
That made him smile.
“You find this amusing?”
“Indeed.”
Her eyes narrowed. “I’m going to count to ten. It’s your last
chance. If you’re not out the door by then—”
“Safir et Fils is on the verge of collapse.”
She blinked. “Who?”
“Safir et Fils,” he repeated impatiently. “The French firm that
was awarded the commission.” She was staring at him blankly.
“Come on, Ms. Santos,” he said silkily. “Don’t try and tell me
the name of the company that won a commission you were
willing to prostitute yourself to get has slipped your—”
Her hand flew through the air but he was quicker than she was.
He caught her wrist, dragged her forward and hauled her to her toes.
“Do not,” he said with quiet menace, “ever raise your hand
to me again!”
“Let go of me!”
“Did you hear what I said?—”
“What a bastard you are!”
Her voice shook; tears glittered in her eyes and she was
breathing hard. So what? He was unimpressed.
“Playing the righteous innocent will get you nowhere, agapi
mou. You made a fool of me once but I promise you, it will never
38 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
happen again. And do not call me names. I am a prince. I urge
you to remember that.”
He almost winced. He sounded like an ass but how could he
think while hot rage pumped through his blood? She was an excellent
actress; he knew that. And this was another stellar performance.
The damp eyes. The trembling voice. The patches of
crimson on her face.
Her face. Beautiful, even now.
“Did you think you could get away with what you did, Maria?
Letting me think you’d been carried away by passion when what
carried you away was the greedy hope that sleeping with me
would give you an advantage in the design competition?”
He paused. Maria stared at him.
Was he waiting for her to answer? What was the point? If she
said he was wrong, he wouldn’t believe her. He hadn’t, that
awful morning.
“Liar,” he’d said, in a voice cold as death, and then he’d hurled
words at her in Greek that she hadn’t understood, though their
meaning had been painfully clear.
Trying to make him listen now would not only be pointless,
it would be demeaning.
The truth was, she hadn’t even known who he was that night.
Aprince? The son of Queen Tia and KingAegeus?As far as she’d
known, he was just a man.A gorgeous, incredibly sexy, fascinating
stranger whose smile, whose touch had made her breathless.
When he’d kissed her and the kisses hadn’t been enough,
when he’d touched her and those touches weren’t enough, she’d
forgotten everything—that they were in a public place, that she
was a moral woman, that she had never been with a man before.
And when he’d whispered, Come with me, she had gone with
him. How could she have done anything else?
Her world had been reduced to him. To his mouth. His hands.
His hard, flagrantly aroused masculinity. She still couldn’t
believe she’d let such a thing happen. You didn’t sleep with a
stranger. She didn’t, anyway.
“What’s the matter, sweetheart? Is that busy little brain of
SANDRA MARTON 39
yours trying to come up with an answer that will satisfy me?”
His voice roughened. “Don’t waste your time. There’s only one
thing that will satisfy me, and you know what that is.”
What he meant was in his eyes.
She saw it and stumbled back. He could see the beat of her
pulse in the hollow of her throat. Good, he thought coldly. This
time, at least, he had the advantage. Command had slipped from
her hands to his and she hadn’t even heard the worst of what he’d
come to tell her.
“Get out.”
She spoke in a papery whisper that he ignored. Instead, he
turned his back and walked to her work table. Sketches were
tacked to an enormous corkboard on the wall above it.
Something that looked as if it had been molded from wax stood
on a shelf.
“Didn’t you hear me? I said—”
“Didn’t you hear me?” He swung toward her, arms folded, feet
crossed at the ankles. “Safir et Fils are going under.”
“Do you expect me to weep for them?”
“They will not be able tomake the gift formymother’s birthday.”
Her smile was pure saccharine. “Stop at Wal-Mart before
you fly home.”
“I know you find this amusing, Maria, but it’s deadly serious.
March the seventh will be an important day. My father has
declared it a national holiday.”
Again, that glittery smile. She had her composure back—but
not for long.
“There will be a ball attended by dignitaries from around
the world.”
“Yes, well if you can’t find anything you like atWal-Mart—”
“My parents have chosen you to execute the commission.”
Her jaw dropped. She was speechless. Twice in one evening.
He had the feeling it was some kind of record.
“Me?”
“You.” His mouth twisted. “You see, despite what I told you
that night, I never mentioned your little game to either the king
40 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
or the queen. I didn’t have to. My father had chosen the French
jewelers. He preferred their submission.”
Maria swallowed hard. She wanted to shriek with delight but
she’d be damned if she gave him that.
“How—how nice. To be second-best.”
“Please. Sarcasm doesn’t become you.” Why mention that the
queen had preferred her design all along? “We both know that
this is the chance of a lifetime for a woman like you.”
Her cheeks flushed again. “What, exactly, is that supposed to
mean?”
“Why, only that your name, your career will be made when
word gets out, Maria. What else could it possibly mean?”
She was sure that hadn’t been his meaning but why argue
about it? The fact was, he had it right. Orders would double.
They’d triple! Tiffany would give her a window display; so would
Barney’s. Vogue, Vanity Fair, Allure, Elle, Marie Claire…every
fashion magazine in the world would camp on her doorstep and
the noxious pseudo-Frenchman would be on his knees, begging
her to design for L’Orangerie.
If only the court hadn’t sent the prince to give her the news.
“They sent me,” Alex said, as if he’d read her mind, “because
they wanted to be sure you understood the full importance of this
commission.”
“You mean,” Maria countered sweetly, “because the king
thought your illustrious royal presence would impress me.” He
grinned. Her gaze on him narrowed. “Too bad your father doesn’t
know you as well as I do.”
All at once, Alex was weary of the game. Why in hell had he
ever thought he needed to settle scores? He was not a man who
enjoyed revenge; God knew there was plenty of opportunity for
it in business but he had always seen vengeance-seeking as a low
sport.And payback against awoman, even one who really needed
to be taught a lesson, suddenly held no appeal.
“What’s your answer?” he said brusquely. He pushed back his
sleeve, shot an impatient glance at his watch. “My pilot is
standing by. Weather permitting, I want to fly home tonight.”
SANDRA MARTON 41
Maria chewed on her lip. God, the man was arrogant. If
only she could tell him what he could do with his offer, but
he was right. This would jump-start her career. Nothing she
could ever do would match its importance. She had to say
‘yes’, but surely there was a way to do it so she could regain
her authority.
“Very well,” she said. “I’ll accept the commission.”
He nodded and reached into the inside breast pocket of his
leather jacket.
“Good. I have some papers here…”
“There are certain conditions to be met,” she said as she took
the documents from him.
His dark eyebrows rose. “There are, indeed. Dates of
approval. A date of completion. An agreement as to what you
may and may not discuss with the media—”
“One,” Maria said, “I work alone. If I need an assistant, that
person will be of my choosing.”
“I don’t think you understand. This agreement concerns the
demands of the—”
“Two, I’ll need some new equipment.” She smiled thinly.
“Aristo’s cost. Not mine.”
Alex’s mouth flattened. “You’re fortunate to be getting this
commission, Ms. Santos. Perhaps you’ve forgotten that.”
“Three. I do not work well with anyone watching over my
shoulder. In otherwords, I’ll be happy to showmywork, as it progresses,
to the king and queen at their request—but no one else.”
The muscle in Alex’s jaw jumped to attention. “Is that last
directed at me?”
“Four,” Maria said, raising her hand and ticking the point off
on her finger, but he had stopped listening.
Who did she think she was, this snippet of a female? He was
not of the old school; nobody had to bow to him or bend a knee
in a deep curtsy, well, except, of course, on formal occasions of
the court, but he was entitled to the respect he had been born to
as a prince, the respect he had won as a man—
“If all those conditions are agreeable, I’ll sign your document.”
42 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
Alex didn’t answer. He stood watching her from dark, unreadable
eyes and felt the tension inside him growing.
He had left Aristo knowing he had to deal with Maria Santos
and keep his composure. Nothing more.
Then another thought had come to him. He would bed her
again. Right here. Tonight. It was he who would do the seducing
this time, if not with his body then with the commission she’d so
willingly sold her soul to get. He’d strip her naked, touch her
everywhere, kneel between her thighs and take her again and
again and again, until she was out of his system.
A moment ago, he’d come full circle. Told himself that plan
was crazy. It was not him. Taking a woman out of revenge was
beneath him. It was, he’d told himself, enough that she’d know
she was getting the commission only because the true winner of
the competition was out of the picture.
There’d been that instant of pleasure.
Then she’d taken that instant and crushed it.
Who did she think she was, to make demands of him? Of the
royal court? Did she think she had the right to treat him as if he
were an errand boy?
“Are you listening to me, Your Highness?”
Alex looked at her. Her eyes glittered with contempt; her very
posture confirmed it. Oh yes. She saw him as an errand boy. Not
her mark this time. The court’s errand boy.
“I take it you heard my last stipulation,” she said. “I will not
deal with you after tonight. Is that clear?”
He could feel his body humming with anger. He wanted to
haul her into his arms and shake her. Humiliate her. Conquer her.
Strip her of that ridiculous pair of sweats, bare her to his eyes,
his hands, his mouth…
He took a step forward. Something of what he felt must have
shown in his face because she paled and took a step back. That’s
right, he thought coldly. Be afraid of me, Maria. Be afraid of
what I’m going to do…
The phone rang. She grabbed it as if it were a lifeline.
“Hello?” She listened, then cleared her throat. “Yes, sí, I
SANDRA MARTON 43
know. Yes, I know that, too. I’m sorry you had to wait for my
call.” Her eyes swept to Alex; she turned her back as if that
would give her the privacy she needed. “Could we discuss this
another time?” she said in a low voice.
Alex had moved with her; his eyes, fixed on her, still held that
dangerous glitter. Didn’t he understand she needed privacy? Who
did he think she was talking to? Joaquin, probably. That almost
made her laugh. The voice whining in her ear was her mother’s.
And hearing from Luz was the last thing she needed right now.
She turned again, desperately wishing this were a cordless
phone so she could walk further away. Her mother was telling
her about her cousin Angela—snide, holier-than-thou Angela—
and her latest promotion at the insurance company. Maria had
only to ask, Luz was saying, as she did every few weeks, and
Angela would get her a job interview.
“Let me tell you my wonderful news,” she said quickly,
breaking into her mother’s endless praise for Angela. “That commission?
The one to design the birthday jewels for Queen Tia of
Aristo? Well, I’ve landed it.”
She waited, although she really didn’t know what she was
waiting for. She knew better than to think her mother would
shriek with joy and say, I’m so proud of you, mia bella, or even,
That’s wonderful news. But she didn’t really expect Luz to say,
“You?” as if such a thing were impossible.
“You lost the competition.You were not good enough to win it.”
Maria winced. “Yes. Well—well, things changed. There was
a problem with the winner and so—”
“Ah.” Her mother’s sigh spoke volumes. “Well, no matter
how you came by it, it is an opportunity. Be sure you do nothing
to ruin it.”
Maria felt like weeping, which was ridiculous. Why should
tonight be different than the past twenty-eight years?
What made it evenworsewas that Alex had not taken his eyes
from her. It was infuriating. His Royal Highness was a Royal
Boor when it came to manners. Didn’t he know enough to walk
away when someone was having a private conversation?
44 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
“One of the things your cousin Angela has always done is to
make the most of her chances.”
“Yes. I know.” Maria cleared her throat. “It’s late. I’ll talk to
you tomorrow.”
Another deep sigh came over the phone. “God willing I will
be here tomorrow. And please, Maria, do not waste time telling
me the doctors saymyhealth is excellent.What do doctors know?”
There was no point in answering. That road, well-traveled
over the decades, led nowhere.
“Good night,” Maria said, “I love—”
Too late. Luz had already disconnected. Maria put down the
phone and swallowed hard. The Prince of Arrogance hadn’t
moved; he was still standing right next to her. She drew a long
breath, let it out as slowly as she could, then turned to face him.
“Wasn’t he interested in your charming declaration of affection?”
“Excuse me?”
“Your lover. Joaquin. I had the impression he ended the call
rather abruptly. Didn’t your news please him?”
“That wasn’t—” She bit her lip. Would having a lover,
however imaginary, offer her some protection? She needed protection;
every instinct told her that. “That wasn’t polite,” she said.
“Listening to my conversation.”
He smiled thinly. “And you, Ms. Santos, are the expert on etiquette,
are you not?” The smile vanished; he shoved a gold pen
at her. “Sign the contract.”
Why did that sound so ominous? “I insist you meet my conditions
before I—”
Suddenly, his hands were on her, cupping her shoulders,
lifting her to her toes.
“You’re lucky to be getting this commission,” he said coldly.
“We both know that. You’re desperate for money—please, don’t
waste my time denying it. And you need the prestige that comes
with creating a necklace for a queen.” His tone hardened. “Sign
the contract, Maria.”
SANDRA MARTON 45
Her lip trembled. She looked away from him and, for a heartbeat,
he hated himself.
Was he really reduced to this? Bullying a woman on the skids?
A woman whose lover had obviously not said a word to congratulate
her on winning this commission?
And why should he give a damn? Maria Santos was nothing
to him.
“Sign the papers,” he growled.
She picked up the pen, smoothed out the documents, laid them
on the table and scribbled her name where he indicated. He felt a
surge of heat sweep through him. But he said nothing, simply took
the papers, folded them and tucked them back in his pocket.
“As for conditions…there are others besides the ones I mentioned.
There are my conditions,” he said in a softly ominous
tone. “And you will meet them.”
His gaze dropped to her lips. She felt her pulse begin to race.
Whatever he was about to say was going to turn her world upside
down; she could sense it.
“One,” he said, still in that soft voice, “you shall have the
studio of your dreams—but on Aristo, not here.”
“Are you insane? I have no intention of—”
“I assume your passport is in order.”
“Of course, but—”
“You will leave with me, tonight.”
“You cannot do this to—”
He bent to her and kissed her. Kissed her as if she belonged
to him, his tongue in her mouth, his hands cupping her bottom,
lifting her to him, into him, into the heavy thrust of his erection.
“And,” he said thickly, when he finally raised his head, “you
will warm my bed until you finish the job.”
“No!” She shook her head as if to emphasize her refusal.
“No,” she said again, her voice high and wild, “I’ll never—”
“You will, or I’ll do what I should have done when you left
my bed the first time. I’ll tell the queen about our little adventure.
I’ll tell her you’re not worthy of designing her gift or of
working in proximity to her. And then you can stay in this loft
46 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
and forever live with the knowledge that you failed at the one
thing that could have changed your life.”
Maria wanted to weep but she knew damned well her tears
would have made him not just the victor but the conqueror.
Instead, she forced herself to meet his gaze without flinching.
“Is this how you get your women, Your Highness? Through
blackmail?”
His eyes flashed a warning. She tried to pull away but his
mouth swooped down to hers; his hands swept into her hair,
holding her captive to his merciless kiss until, at last, a sweet
moan whispered from her throat.
Despite her fury and her hatred, it was happening again.
The hot spiral of desire she’d felt that night all those weeks ago.
The sudden swift race of her heart. All those amazing, incredible
feelings she’d never known before were sweeping her away.
She was dizzy in his arms, dizzy from the taste of him, the
scent, the feel of his hand, now in her hair, his fingers cupping
her scalp. He gathered her even closer. The hard press of his
arousal dug into her belly.
Oh God. She wanted him, wanted him, wanted him…
Mariawound her arms aroundAlex’s neck and kissed him back.
CHAPTER FOUR
SHE was on fire.
It had been like this that night on Aristo.
Alex had kissed her, and it had been like touching a match to
tinder.
Until then, she’d always thought descriptions like that were
clichés, the stuff of novels and movies, but Alex had taken her
in his arms and taught her that a man’s touch could change everything
you knew, everything you believed, forever.
One kiss. Onewarm mingling of breath. One caress of lips and
tongues and you were transformed, became someone else.
Someone you didn’t know, didn’t understand.
Didn’t respect.
Her eyes flew open. She slammed her hands against Alex’s
broad chest. He made a sound that was almost a growl and
gathered her closer. Her struggles increased.
“Alex! Damn you, let me go.”
For a moment, herwords didn’t penetrate.Hewas lost in the taste
of Maria, the feel of her soft body against his. But her hands became
small fists, hammering at his shoulders. The message was clear.A
moment’s tease, just enough to drive him half out of his mind…
It wasn’t going to work.
He opened his eyes and let go of her.
“Pack your things.”
His voice was low and rough, his muscles taut with anger and
48 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
frustration. She had a way of getting to him and he didn’t like it.
It was not something he was accustomed to.
“That’s it?” Her voice shook with indignation. “You walk in
here, announce that I’m going to—to be your sex slave—”
“My mistress,” he said, mentally cursing himself. How had
she reduced him to this?
“You think that makes it better? You cannot walk in here, manhandle
me and expect—expect—”
“Is that what you call it when you turn soft and hot in a man’s
arms and all but beg him to take you?”
Her face colored. “Get out!”
“Try singing a different tune, agapimeni. The one about being
a shocked virgin is getting tiresome.”
“Is there something about ‘get out’ you don’t understand?”
“And what of the contract you just signed, Maria? Shall I take
that to court and have a judge deal with it?”
“Don’t threaten me!”
“It’s not a threat, it’s a warning. You’ve committed to creating
the queen’s birthday gift, to be completed by twenty-eight
February and subject to my approval.”
“Your approval?”
“Indeed,” he said coldly. “Perhaps you should have read the
contract more thoroughly.”
Maria wanted to laugh. Or cry. Either seemed appropriate.A
minute ago, Alex had been kissing her passionately. Now, he was
talking to her as if he were a prosecutor and she a balky witness.
Did he think he could use sex to control her? Or maybe he
thought he could bully her. Big mistake! She’d grown up on the
streets of the Bronx. What was royal arrogance compared to
Bronx attitude?
“Contracts,” she said, just as coldly, “are made to be broken.”
Alex raised an eyebrow. “Did you lift that line from some
trendy legal show?”
She flushed. Close enough. She’d taken it from an article
about how a hotshot movie star had gotten away with walking
out on a film.
SANDRA MARTON 49
“And you’re right,” he said, taking the contract from his
pocket, flipping to a page and holding it out. “Some are. This one
is not. Take a look at paragraph three.”
Why did doing as he’d suggested smack of defeat? Was it his
smug tone, or was it the instinctive knowledge that what she’d
find in that paragraph would not be good? She snatched the
contract from his hand, read the pertinent sentences…and felt a
shock of disbelief flash through every nerve in her body.
Failure of the party of the first part to complete the agreedupon
commission and/or to fulfill the additional duties required
of her in their entirety…
Her head snapped up. “What?”
“Ah,” he said, his voice a low purr, “I can see that you really
didn’t read this before you signed it.A bad decision, I’m afraid.”
“That’s insane! You cannot contract for—for a mistress…”
“Keep reading,” he said softly.
Did she have a choice? Her gaze dropped to the contract.
Such failure shall result in forfeiture of all goods and services
already provided and repayment for same.
“What goods and services?” She looked up and flashed a triumphant
smile. “You haven’t provided any.”
“Have you forgotten you’re flying to Aristo with me? Did you
think I wouldn’t provide you with a workshop and tools?” He
jerked his chin toward the contract. “There’s more.”
Finally, in the event of forfeiture, an additional penalty to be
paid by Maria Santos in the amount of…
The typed-in number had so many zeroes it made her laugh.
Alex’s eyes narrowed.
“I assure you, this is not meant for your amusement.”
No. Of course not, but what else could she do when the
penalty for walking away was easily ten times the value of everything
she owned?
“You must know I can’t afford anything even close to that!”
He shrugged. “I know only what is in the agreement you
just signed.”
He sounded as removed as if they were discussing when the
50 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
snow might stop. It not only killed her hysterical laughter, it
killed any hope she’d had that this was a joke.
“But—but I’d lose everything. This loft. My clients. The
people I deal with would suffer, the ones who subcontract to me.
And Joaquin, who’s been with me from the start—”
“Your lover’s welfare is not my concern.”
“Joaquin is not my lover.” Maria flung the contract at his feet.
“He works for me.”
He bent and picked it up, smoothing the pages, his expression
blank.
“It doesn’t matter one way or the other. My only concern is
this contract. Are you going to abide by it or not?
She stared at him, hating him, hating herself even more. How
could she have slept with him that night? Better still, how could
she have returned his kisses just now? Was she truly, pathetically
her mother’s daughter?
She wanted to curse him. To pummel those broad shoulders
with her fists, but what would that change? Nothing, she thought
bitterly, nothing at all.
“This is usury!”
He grinned. Such a ruggedly beautiful face, she thought
wildly, made even sexier by that quick devil’s smile.
“An impressive legal term,” he said. “But incorrect. The
penalty to which you’ve agreed has nothing to do with a loan.”
“Damn it,” she exploded, “do not play word games with me!
I know what usury means. And I know what this contract is.
Unconscionable. Immoral. Cruel and mean-spirited and—”
“And enforceable.”
“You cannot coerce a woman into—what was your phrase?
Into warming your bed!”
Suddenly, he was standing much too close. She stumbled back
but his big hands were already framing her face and lifting it to him.
“There’s not a word that even hints of coercion in that
contract,” he said softly. “You signed it of your own free will.”
“How can you do this?” she said shakily. “Don’t you have
any scruples?”
SANDRA MARTON 51
He laughed softly. “An interesting question, coming from
you.” His smile faded; his gaze dropped to her lips. “One month,
agapi mou. That’s all it will be. One month of being in my bed.
Of spending the nights with me deep inside you.” His lips
twitched, as if he’d made a joke, but his eyes were so dark they
seemed bottomless. “I can endure it, if you can.”
His words made her blush. How could he joke about the
devil’s bargain he was forcing on her?
“I hate you,” Maria snapped.
Alex grinned. “Hate me all you like, sweetheart. It’s not your
heart I’m after.”
No, she thought, no, it wasn’t. And that was fine because her
heart would never be part of this arrangement.
“Understand something, Your Highness,” she said, searching
for and finding a way to salvage one tiny bit of pride. “Being in
your bed is one thing. Participating in what happens there is not
something you can ever expect.”
His teeth flashed in a quick smile. “A challenge?”
“A statement of fact.”
“A challenge,” he said flatly. “One I am happy to accept.”
He bent his head, brushed his lips over hers. His mouth moved
against hers again and again in the lightest of kisses. She wanted
to lean into him. Wanted to close her eyes, part her lips, clasp his
head and bring it down closer to hers…
I feel nothing, she told herself.
And wished to God it were true.
What in the name of Chronos was she doing? Was she packing
everything she owned? Jeans. T-shirts. Sweaters. Sneakers and
sandals and, hell, another pair of jeans.
Alex looked at his watch, scowled and shook his wrist. Was
the damned thing working? Impossible that only five minutes had
passed since she’d first turned on her heel, marched away from
him and dragged a suitcase from a corner of the loft.
The loft. Her loft. His lip all but curled. He’d been in
Manhattan lofts before. Soaring ceilings. Enormous windows.
52 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
Brick walls and polished wood floors. Furniture from
Scandinavia that made the most of all that open space.
Maria’s loft lacked only whatever machines had once been installed
here. Raw space, NewYork realtors called it, and made it
sound as if that was a good thing—which, he supposed, it was if
you intended to transform it into something habitable.
This was not habitable.
The floor was wood but the finish had long since worn away.
The walls were brick. Not warm brick, just brick. Old, dark, depressing.
The ceiling soared, all right. It soared straight up to an
intimidating tangle of pipes and electrical lines.
As for furniture…there were a couple of work tables. Some
cabinets and benches. Boxes. More boxes. And, in this end of the
room, farthest from the entry door, a screen that he assumed concealed
the bathroom, or what passed for a bathroom, and in front
of that, a bed.
Maria’s bed.
Neatly made. Simple. Almost convent-like in appearance…
A double bed.
Alex’s jaw tightened.
His own bed—his beds, considering the number of homes he
owned—his beds were always king-sized. A bachelor’s necessity,
his brothers called them. Plenty of room for a man and a
woman and hours of hot sex.
But a double bed might have advantages.
There’d be little space in which to sprawl while the lovers in
Maria’s bed took some needed rest. They would have to sleep
on their sides, spoon fashion, she with her backside tucked into
his groin, her spill of wild, sexy curls tucked beneath his chin.
He would wake during the night, feel the heat of her against him
and his sex would engorge, fill with heat, throb as he shifted his
weight, as she backed up to him, as she awoke and drowsily whispered
his name while he sought her moist entrance, while he
pistoned within her until she cried out…
Skata!
He was watching Maria pack and turning himself on.
SANDRA MARTON 53
How could she have that much power over him? He didn’t like
it, not one bit. Men were the ones who held power and if that
marked him as old-fashioned, so be it.
He had surely made the right move. Taking her to his bed as
often as he wishedwould purge her from his system.And no matter
what she said, she would not be unwilling for long. She could talk
about not wanting him all she liked but when he touched her, all
that staunch denial fled.To hell with the fact that she despised him.
He felt the same about her. What he’d told her was true enough.
Sex had nothing to do with emotion.
As for her threat not to react in his bed… A lie. A magnificent
lie. He knew a thousand ways to make her react. His mouth
at her breasts. Between her thighs. On her clitoris…
“Damn it,” he growled, and strode toward the bed on which
her suitcase stood open. “That’s enough!”
She swung toward him. “What?”
“Perhaps you have forgotten what my country is like,” he said
through his teeth. “It is not the wilderness.We have shops.”
The understatement of the year, Maria thought. Ellos had all
the shops that made Fifth Avenue paradise and dozens more.
Unfortunately, it had the prices to go with them. She wouldn’t
have the money to step through those doors until she completed
this commission. One new outfit, she’d been in debt for life.
Not that that was a possibility. The outfit she’d worn today
had pretty much melted her credit card.
“Excuse me,” she said with enough sugar in the words to
cause diabetic coma, “but I’m not done.”
“You are done,” he said grimly. “You’ve packed enough for
ten women.”
What she’d done was pack enough for one woman who had
no idea what the weather was like halfway around the world this
time of year.Yes, she could ask him, but that would be a show of
weakness. Stupid, perhaps, but that was the way she felt.
So she’d taken jeans. T-shirts. Sandals. Hiking boots.
Sweaters. She’d considered something dressy, but what for? She
would not be going out in the evenings.
54 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
She would be going to the prince’s bed.
She stared at him as he closed the suitcase. She hated him as
a woman; as an artist, she couldn’t help but admire him.Well, no.
Not him. NotAlexandros Karedes.What she admiredwas his long,
leanly muscled body. His wide shoulders and broad chest. Narrow
hips and long legs. The black-as-midnight hair, the dark eyes, the
face that Praxiteles might have chiseled from the finest marble.
He was even more beautiful nude.
She remembered that. The corded muscles in his arms. The
ridged abs. The powerful thrust of his penis rising from a cluster
of dark curls…
Maria swung away and went to the workshop end of the loft.
Forget that. Block it from her mind. Besides, despite all that
about the contract, he couldn’t mean to enforce such a demand.
The more she thought about it, the more assured she grew that
the sleep-with-me nonsense was just a particularly nasty way of
reminding her that she had no standing in his world.
Fine, she thought, plucking a big leather tote from a shelf and
sweeping a handful of tools into it, absolutely fine. Let him play
his stupid games. One month, that was all, a month of his
bullying tactics and then—
Unless she was wrong.
What if hewas serious? What if he really expected her to sleep
with him? Well, not ‘sleep’. She remembered that one night in
his bed. They hadn’t slept at all. He’d taken her over and over,
driven her out of her mind each time, made her do things…
No. Her breath caught.
He hadn’t ‘made’ her do anything. She’d wanted to do them,
things she’d heard of and read about but never, ever imagined
she’d want to do.
And would never do again.
Blindly, she grabbed another handful of tools and dumped
them in the tote.
What she’d told him was true. If he insisted on holding her to
their devil’s bargain, she would not participate. She would lie in
his bed but shewould not move. She’d let his hands seek out every
SANDRA MARTON 55
shadowed valley. Let him put his mouth on hers. On her breasts.
Between her thighs. She’d let him do everything he wanted but
she would not react, she would not, would not…
She gasped as Alex grabbed the tote from her, snapped the
lock, then hoisted it and her suitcase from the floor.
“We’re leaving.”
“I need the rest of those tools—or maybe you thought I work
gold and precious stones with tweezers and a crowbar?”
“Did you not hear me when I said you will have the studio of
your dreams?”
“I heard you. I still want my own things. It’s how people are,
when they’ve worked at the same job for a while. They want the
stuff they’re familiar with, whether it’s a pen or a chisel. I know
that’s difficult for you to get your head around, considering that
you’ve never had to do a day’s work in your life, so you’ll just
have to take my word for it.”
Alex narrowed his eyes. Was that really how she saw him? As
a royal dilettante? He thought back to his father’s initial reaction
when he’d first approached him about bringing new economic
life to Aristo.
“What could you possibly bring to Aristo that I have not?”
Aegeus said, with his usual imperialistic charm.
A casino, for one.A new commercial port that specialized in
handling enormous cargo ships. A colony of upscale second or
third or fourth or even fifth homes for multi-billionaires looking
for seclusion on the island’s northeast coast overlooking the Bay
of Apollonia. He had even managed to divert some of the superrich
from building in the new resort town of Jaladhar on the
island of Calista, which, together with Aristo, had made up the
Kingdom of Adamas until they’d been declared separate nations
by his grandfather, King Christos, more than three decades ago.
So, no. Oh, no. He had never worked a day in his life. He travelled
between his offices in New York and Ellos, he flew to all
the major cities of the world, met and negotiated with hardheaded
businessmen and heads of state and it was all nothing but
a wealthy man’s hobby. Or so this woman thought.
56 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
He glared at Maria. At the smug little smile on her lips. Part
of him wanted to grab her and shake her.
Part wanted to pull her into his arms and kiss her until she
begged for him to do more.
Thank God he wasn’t fool enough to do either. Instead, he
jerked his chin in her direction.
“Coat,” he said briskly. “And shoes. Make it quick or I’ll sling
you over my shoulder and carry you downstairs just as you are.”
He would do it, too.
Maria knew that.
So she pulled on heavy socks, a pair of bulky boots she’d
bought the winter she’d almost—almost—decided to try skiing,
stuffed her arms through the sleeves of a warm but ugly vintage
parka she’d found at the Hell’s Kitchen flea market, secured her
wild mop of hair with a scrunchy and marched to the door.
Let His Mightiness see what kind of bed-warmer he’d bought
himself, she thought grimly.
Useless. He didn’t even blink. Instead, he motioned her
toward the steps and followed her out of the building. The snow
was still coming down but the flakes were big and slow, the kind
that normally turned the city into a wonderland.
She could see nothing wonderful about it tonight.
As they stepped off the curb a uniformed driver sprang from
behind the wheel of the big limo, touched a finger to his cap and
clicked his heels.
Maria snorted.
Alex ignored her.
“Hans,” he said.
Hans clicked his heels again. Alex thought about telling him
to stop doing that but he’d already told him the same thing at least
a dozen times. Apparently, Hans was one of those people who
dreamed of the grandeur that was royalty.
Maria, clearly, was not.
Hans reached for the bags. “I’ll put them in the trunk,” Alex
said sharply. “You see to Ms. Santos.”
Another click. Maria rolled her eyes. Hans swept open the rear
SANDRA MARTON 57
passenger door, gave her a little bow as she stepped inside the
car. The door shut with the sort of solid ‘thunk’ she figured you
expected when a car cost as much as a house. A swirl of warm
air, perfumed with the scent of expensive leather, swallowed her
up as she fell back into the soft seat.
The only thing that spoiled it was Alex, who opened the other
rear door and got in beside her.
“The airport,” he said.
The car moved gracefully from the curb. Maria’s gut moved,
too, but not gracefully. What in the world was she doing? She
had to phone Joaquin to say she was leaving, and she certainly
had to say goodbye to her mother.
“Wait!”
The car stopped. Alex turned toward her. “Whatever you
forgot,” he said coldly, “can stay right where it is.”
“No. I mean, it can’t. I mean…” She took a deep breath. “I
can’t go with you.”
Alex folded his arms. “We’ve been through all this.”
“I can’t just leave. I mean…I have to let people know. I have
to say goodbye.”
“People,” he said coldly. “You mean, your ‘friend’, Joaquin.”
She thought of correcting him, but what for? He could believe
what he liked.
“And will you tell him the intimate details of our arrangement,
glyka mou?” he said with a sly smile.
Her head came up. “I will never tell anyone about that.”
He stared at her for a long minute. For some insane reason,
he wanted to take her in his arms and tell her he would not hurt
her, that he would do all he could to bring her pleasure…
To hell with that.
“What’s his address?”
“Why?”
“Hans is an excellent driver,” Alex said with a tight smile,
“but he has one flaw. He can’t find a place unless I give him
its address.”
“Oh,” she said quickly, “no, that isn’t necessary. Just—Driver?
58 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
Driver, there’s a subway stop two blocks up. If you’d drop me
off there—and then I can, ah, I can meet you somewhere later…”
“The address,” Alex said quietly, but in a tone so filled with
authority that Maria knew she’d lost.
She sank back in her seat.
“One seven four oh Grandview Avenue,” she said in a small
voice. “That’s in the Bronx.”
“The Bronx?” the driver said.
“The Bronx,” Alex repeated firmly, and the big car started up
again.
Alex watched Maria’s face as the limo made its way along the
snow-laden streets.
She sat huddled in the corner, as far from him as she could
get, staring straight ahead, her face pale in the glaring headlights
of the few cars coming toward them. The snow had all but
emptied the city streets.
She was trembling.
He frowned. Was she cold? Impossible. The sole virtue of that
ugly jacket had to be its warmth. Besides, the car’s interior was
warm.
Shewas nervous, then. Or anxious.About agreeing to go with
him? Not that she’d actually agreed. He’d forced her into it.
Never mind.
Was she nervous about telling her lover she was going away
with another man? Alex’s jaw tightened.A week from now, hell,
a couple of hours from now, her loverwould be history. Once they
boarded his private plane, he’d take her to the big bedroom in the
rear of the cabin, strip her out of that foolish outfit and touch her
in ways that would make her forget any man but him.
That was how it had been that night.
Maria, blind with passion. Her skin, silken to the touch. Her
mouth drinking from his, her fingers cool against his body, her
hands trembling when he clasped them, brought them to his
chest, his belly, his erection.
Touch me this way, he’d murmured. Yes. Like that. Like that.
SANDRA MARTON 59
She’s never done this before, he’d thought in amazement.
And then he’d simply stopped thinking, lost in the heat that
consumed them.
What a lie!
She’d done everything before. He’d known it as soon as he
heard her on the telephone that morning. Until then, she’d had
him fooled. And that wasn’t easy. He’d been with a lot of women.
Too many, he sometimes thought; their faces and names and
bodies had become blurred over the years.
Not hers.
Maria’s name, her heart-shaped face and its delicate features,
her body that was softly curved and not a fashionable arrangement
of hard bones and flesh, even her voice…
He had forgotten nothing. She came to him in his dreams,
telling him she wanted him.
Turning yourself on again, you idiot? he thought angrily as
he shifted in the deep leather seat.
Well, there’d be no more of that.
He knew what this was all about, if he was honest. Ego?
Maybe a little. Anger? Okay, that, too. Payback? Absolutely.
But the real reason he wanted her was much more basic.
The hair of the dog that bit you. Driving out demons.
Whatever you wanted to call it. Have enough sex with Maria
Santos and he’d wipe her name, her face, everything about her
from his mind.
A month from now, he’d be happy to see the last of her.
Whether she was clever in bed or not, he’d never come across a
woman who could hold his interest for much longer than that.
This one would be no exception, not even if she went from waif
to temptress, fire to ice…
“It’s the building right over there.”
Her voice was low. Alex blinked and realized the car had
slowed to a crawl. He looked out the window and saw a nondescript
street, cars packed tightly along the curb, and a looming
wall of apartment buildings.
“This one, miss?” Hans asked.
60 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
“Sí.Yes.”
It was the first time she’d lapsed into Spanish since the phone
call—and since she’d cursed him. She sounded breathless.
Stressed. His jaw tightened. Was she nervous about visiting her
lover and telling him her plans?
If he’d been her lover, she’d have had the right to be terrified.
He could not imagine agreeing to her going off with another man
for a month. Not for a day. Not if she belonged to him.
The limo eased into the space beside a fire hydrant. The driver
turned off the engine and reached for the door handle.
“Thank you,” Maria said quickly, “but that isn’t necessary. I
can open the door my—”
“Stay in the car, Hans.” Alex’s voice was cold. “I’ll take care
of Ms. Santos.”
A blast of frigid air swept in as he opened the door. Maria’s
heart skipped a beat. Did the Prince of Arrogance think he was
going inside with her? Not in a million years.
“Thank you,” she said, forcing a polite smile, “but I can manage.”
“Don’t be silly, glyka mou. It’s late, the street is nearly
deserted. What kind of gentleman would permit a woman to be
alone under such conditions?”
His tone had gone from harsh to silken. A spider’s web was
silken, too. She didn’t want him with her, not only because then
he would know she hadn’t come to see Joaquin but because he
would know too much.
“Maria. I’m waiting.”
Hewas leaning into the car, his patrician face rigid.Anger swept
through her. Did he think he could take over every aspect of her life?
“Keepwaiting, then. I don’t require your assistance.And let me
assure you,Your Highness, if you think you are a gentleman—”
She gasped as he caught her shoulders and pulled her from
the car.
“You will not talk to me that way,” he growled. “I don’t give
a damn what you do or do not require. What matters is what I
require. For the next month, you’ll do things my way or not at
all. Is that clear?”
SANDRA MARTON 61
“Yessir,” she said, and touched her stiff fingers to her
forehead. “Of course, sir,” she added, and clicked her heels. Then
she jerked her chin up, stepped around him and marched over
the snowy sidewalk to the building’s entry.
Alex could feel his face burning.
He shot a furious glare at Hans, sitting straight as a ramrod
behind the wheel. He gave no sign that he’d seen or heard what
had just happened.
Alex took a deep breath. Then he trudged after Maria through
the snow. Her feet, in those hideous boots, moved up and down
without interference but he was wearing leather mocs—
handmade leather mocs, he thought grimly, and they were
already cold and sodden.
Great. He was about to come face to face with the man who’d
been her lover and his damned shoes would probably fall off his
feet when he…
Panagia mou!
What kind of place was this for a love nest? The entrance door
had a broken lock. The lobby smelled of mice and mildew. What
remained of a mural clung pathetically to a graffiti-scarred wall.
Therewas an elevator but Maria ignored it and headed for the stairs.
“Four flights,” she said briskly, without looking back at him.
“Are you up to that, Your Highness?”
He didn’t bother replying, he simply climbed the steps
behind her. One flight. Two. Three. At last, they reached the
fifth-floor landing.
“This is where he lives?”
Alex sounded incredulous. She hated him for that, and for
forcing himself into this part of her life.
“Answer me!” He clasped her wrist and spun her toward him.
“Your lover expects you to come to him in a dump like this?”
The door to the apartment directly ahead swung open. Alex
looked up, angry at himself, at Maria, at the unwanted intrusion.
“What the hell do you want?” he snarled at the shadowy
figure in the doorway.
The figure stepped forward into the dim light of the stairwell
62 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
landing. It was a woman. Small. Dark-haired. Wrapped in a
wool bathrobe.
“Maria?”
Maria took a deep breath. “Sí, Mama. It’s me.”
CHAPTER FIVE
IT’S ME, Mama, Maria said.
And then no one said anything.
For an eternity? For a few seconds? Alex couldn’t be sure.
The only certainty was that he’d made one hell of a mistaken
assumption.
And he’d mortified Maria. The proof was in the rigidity of her
posture, the angle of her head. This place, this depressing setting,
this woman making absolutely no move toward her daughter,
were not things she’d wanted him to see.
So what? he asked himself coldly. Wasn’t it his intention to
humiliate Maria Santos? This was just one more way to do it.
But even as he thought that he found himself moving closer
to her, putting his hand lightly on her shoulder in a gesture of
unspoken support.
The woman in the doorway spoke first. Her words were not
those of a loving mother, delighted to see her child. They were,
instead, accusatory.
“Do you have any idea how late it is, Maria? I was on my
way to bed.”
He saw the color rise in Maria’s face. His hand tightened on
her shoulder.
“I’m sorry, Mama. I should have phoned first—”
“And who is this with you? Why have you brought a man
to my home?”
64 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
“Forgive me, Mrs. Santos,”Alex said pleasantly. He gave Maria
what he hopedwas a reassuring smile, then stepped forward. “It’s
my fault, entirely. I’m afraid I was in such a hurry to get things
done that the lateness of the hour never occurred to me.”
“And you are…?”
“I am Alexandros Karedes. Prince Alexandros Karedes.”
The Santos woman’s eyebrows rose.
“Prince?”
“From the kingdom of Aristo. Perhaps you’ve heard of it,” he
said politely, knowing she would have. You could not read a
magazine or see a television program about the rich and famous
without hearing of places like Dubai, Monaco and Aristo.
“And you know my daughter?”
“Indeed. In fact, Maria and I are going to be spending the next
few weeks together.”
Maria gave him a look that should have turned him to stone.
“The prince means we’ll be working together.”
“Maria is making my mother’s birthday gift.”
Luz raised her dark eyebrows. “Maria? Is this what you meant
when I called you a little while ago?”
Alex looked at Maria. She glared even as color rose in her
cheeks. It had been her mother on the phone, not her lover. Why
did that please him? Whether she had a lover or not didn’t matter.
She would be his for the next four weeks. Who gave a damn if
she came home to Joaquin when the month ended?
“Sí, Mama, it was.”
He could almost see Luz mulling that over. Finally, she
stepped aside and motioned them forward. “Come inside. I don’t
want to bother the neighbors.”
Maria looked like a wild animal who wanted to escape a
trap, but she jerked her head in assent and moved past him into
the apartment.
The entry foyer was big; it led down two steps into a living
room that must have been elegant in its day but now was dimly lit
and depressing. Luz made no offer of coffee or tea; she took a chair
and when Maria hovered uncertainly,Alex took her elbow. He felt
SANDRA MARTON 65
her stiffen, knew she wanted to jerk free but she let him draw her
down beside him on a small, sagging, blanket-covered sofa.
“You see,” Alex said pleasantly, “my mother—”
“She is the queen?”
“Queen Tia. Yes. Her sixtieth birthday is next month, and—”
He launched into an explanation of the planned celebration.
The state dinner in the palace. The ball that would follow. The
presentation of Maria’s necklace to the queen at precisely midnight,
followed by fireworks. The fact that Mariawas accompanying him
to Aristo so she could consult personally with the queen and with
him, should questions arise about the design of the piece.
“You mean, my daughter will leave New York?”
“Yes,” Alex said politely, “but I can assure you—”
“Well, if it doesn’t worry her to leave me all alone, who am
I to complain? I am not well, Your Highness. Perhaps Maria has
mentioned it.”
“You’re fine, Mama. Your doctors say—”
“What do doctors know?” Luz crossed herself. “We can only
pray for the best. Besides, I suppose you’re determined to live
out this fantasy of yours.”
Alex could see a vein throb in Maria’s temple.
“Could we please have this discussion another time?” she
said, but Luz ignored her.
“Do you have children, Prince Alexandros?”
“I’m not married, Mrs. Santos,” Alex said politely, though
being polite was growing difficult.
“Well, when you do, you’ll understand that a mother’s sole
concern is for her child’s welfare. Maria’s cousin, Angela—”
“I’m sure the prince isn’t interested in Angela.”
“Angela is a wonderful girl. She has an excellent position with
an insurance company. She’s offered many, many times to
arrange for Maria to have an interview there. Why, only this
evening, I told Maria of Angela’s promotion. She’ll be earning
thirty thousand dollars a year!” Luz leaned toward her daughter.
“And I didn’t get the chance to tell you the rest. Angela’s
engaged. To her supervisor, can you imagine? She has done so
well for herself. It’s hard to believe you and she graduated high
school at the same time.”
The sofa was small. Maria’s thigh was against his. Alex
could feel her trembling.With anger?With despair? Not that it
mattered to him…
“We had different goals,” Maria said carefully. “Angela went
straight to work. I went to college.”
“And quit.”
“I didn’t quit, I changed schools. I went to the Fashion
Institute of Technology.” A touch of pride edged her words. “It
was not easy to get in.”
Luz made a face. “Such foolishness! Two years spent studying
what? Drawing? Making geegaws? And meanwhile, your cousin,
Angela, was—”
The hell with this, Alex thought, and he clasped Maria’s hand.
She tried to tug it away but he threaded his fingers through hers.
“Maria,” he said smoothly, “I think it’s time we told your
mother the truth.”
Her eyes went dark and wild. “Alex. Alex, please—”
“I admire your modesty, glyka mou,” he said softly, “but surely
your mother should know the details—of this commission.”
Maria let out a breath. Luz shrugged her shoulders.
“I know them already, Prince Alexandros. My daughter
entered a contest and lost. She’s won it now because the real
winner backed out.”
“You make it sound as if Maria entered a sweepstakes,
Mrs. Santos,” Alex said with a smile that barely softened the
tightly spoken words. “In fact, fifty of the world’s most
prestigious jewelry designers submitted sketches for my
father’s perusal. He and his ministers narrowed the field to
three but the final selection was the king’s.” He paused. “He
chose an excellent entry—but from the start, Maria’s design
was the queen’s choice.”
Maria’s eyes lit. “Was it?” she said softly.
Alex nodded. What was the harm in telling her the truth?
“The necklace your daughter creates will be photographed by
66 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
every major magazine. It will be featured on television news on
virtually every continent. And when the queen’s birthday celebration
ends, it will be displayed alongside the Crowns of Aristo
and Adamas, two of the most famous royal crowns in the world.”
Luz seemed to take it all in. Then she nodded and looked at
Maria.
“This is a fine opportunity, mia hija.”
“Sí, Mama. I know it is.”
“You must not squander it. Such good fortune may not come
your way again.”
Alex glanced at Maria. She had a stiff smile pinned to her lips.
He couldn’t blame her. Not that her feelings meant anything to
him, but couldn’t her mother work up a little enthusiasm? His
own mother had always been loving. Not the way mothers were
loving in the books he’d read when he was growing up, or even
in the ways he’d observed when he spent an occasional holiday
weekend with a friend from boarding school.
Tia had not tousled his hair or kissed his scraped knees; she
had not tucked him in at night or sat with him at breakfast in the
morning. He’d longed for those things as a kid but he’d understood.
She was the queen. His father was the king. His parents
had grave responsibilities; from his earliest years on, he’d been
groomed to respect that.
But Tia had applauded his every academic achievement and
sports trophy. Even Aegeus, who had always treated his children,
especially his sons, with cool removal, would have offered a
word of praise at news as important as this.
“This was more than good fortune,” he said coolly. Maria
looked at him in surprise. Hell, he’d surprised himself. “Your
daughter’s talent is the reason she won the commission.”
Maria’s counterfeit smile had given way to one that was soft
and sweet. He wanted to cup her face with his hand, taste that
sweetness, kiss her not as he had before but gently, tenderly…
A muscle knotted in his jaw.
“It’s time we left,” he said brusquely, and rose to his feet.
* * *
SANDRA MARTON 67
It had stopped snowing; the street was clear and a plow truck disappearing
just ahead, red lights blinking, was the reason.
Hans popped from the driver’s seat of the big limo and swept
the rear door open. Maria stepped in; Alex followed her.
“Where to, sir?”
What was that sound? Was Maria—was she crying?
“Sir? To the airport?”
Alex forced his attention to his driver, then dug his BlackBerry
from his pocket. There was one text message. It was from his
pilot and it was brief and to the point.
“Runways are open. Flight plan has been filed.”
“The airport,” he said briskly, and settled back in the seat.
The big car moved swiftly through the streets. Maria said
nothing; her face was turned to the window. If she’d been
weeping, she seemed to have stopped.
Alex cleared his throat.
“I forgot to leave my phone number for your mother. I’ll have
my secretary call her with it first thing tomorrow. Is there anyone
else you wish to notify?”
She shook her head.
“Not even—” He paused. Don’t, he told himself, but the need
to say it was the same as the need to touch an aching tooth, even
though you knewitwas a mistake. “Not even your friend, Joaquin?”
She swung toward him. “He is my friend,” she said fiercely,
“despite what you think. And I have my own cell phone, thank
you very much. I don’t need you or your secretary to do it for me.”
“You needn’t bite my head off. I just—I just wondered if,
perhaps—”
“Look, you did one decent thing tonight, Your Highness.
You—you tried to defend me to my mother. I suppose I owe you
my thanks for that. Just don’t—don’t spoil it.”
“I didn’t defend you. I spoke the truth. My mother loved your
design.” He hesitated. “Frankly, I agreed with her that it was the
best. Why should that be a secret?”
She lifted her chin and looked directly at him. They had just
pulled up to a traffic light. The red glow lit her lovely face with
68 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
color and yes, she had been crying. The delicate skin under her
eyes was swollen.
“If it isn’t a secret, why didn’t you tell me right away?”
Alex felt a quick stab of guilt, but why should he? Maria had
not been honest with him, and her lie of omission had been far
greater than his.
“I told you what you needed to know,” he said coldly. “There
was no reason to tell you anything more.”
She gave a little laugh. “Such diplomatic words, Alexandros.
Why, if I didn’t know better, I’d think you were a—” Her face
turned white.
“Maria?”
“Tell the driver to pull over.”
“What is it?”
“I’m going to be—”
Alex lowered the privacy screen and jerked his thumb toward
the curb. Hans steered to it and pulled up,Alex threwhis door open
and Maria shot past him. He was right on her heels; he caught her
by the shoulders as she bent over and was viciously ill.
“Go away,” she gasped. “I don’t want you to—”
Another spasm shook her. He could feel the violence of it and
his hands clasped her more tightly. When she was done, she
stood straight, her back still to him, her body racked with tremors.
“Maria,” he said softly. “Are you okay?”
She nodded. “I’m fine.”
She wasn’t. Her voice was thready and the trembling had increased.
Alex cursed and turned her toward him. She stood with
her head down.
“What happened?”
“I don’t know. Flu, I think. Everyone has it.”
God, she looked so fragile. Not silly, lost in that enormous and
ugly jacket, but terribly, heartbreakingly delicate.
He dug a handkerchief from his pocket and held it toward her.
She shook her head.
“Not your handkerchief. I’ll soil it.”
“Damn it, Maria,” he said, and put his hand under her chin,
SANDRA MARTON 69
lifted her face and dabbed her lips carefully with the snowywhite
linen.
She was still shaking.
Alex lifted her in his arms. “No,” she said, but he ignored her,
ducked his head, carried her inside the car, settled her close
against him and pressed the intercom button.
Hans answered immediately. “Sir?”
“Turn up the heat,” Alex said crisply. “And take us to the
nearest hospital.
“No,” Maria said, even more emphatically. “I don’t want to
go to a hospital.”
“You need a doctor.”
“For heaven’s sake, I was sick. Sick, that’s all. Flu. Or maybe
something I ate.”
“You look like you don’t eat enough,” Alex said, more sharply
than he’d intended but it was true. Holding her in his arms, he’d
realized she was as light as the proverbial feather.
“I am fine. I don’t need to be coddled.”
Yes, he thought, she did—but he knew that edge in her voice
by now, just as he knew the proud angle of her head.
“Okay. Great. No coddling. Hans?”
“Sir?”
“The airport.”
The intercom light blinked off. Maria stared straight ahead,
wrapped in mortification. Of all things to happen.To get sick in front
of this man. To have him insist on staying with her. To have him
wipe her face and now to be sitting within the circle of his arm…
“I am perfectly capable of sitting on my own,” she said coolly.
He let her move away. From the corner of her eye, she could
see him opening a mahogany compartment built into the side of
the car. Taking something from it. A bottle of water. A big white
linen napkin.
“Look at me,” he said as he poured the water on the napkin.
She looked. Their eyes met. What was in his? Pity? Damn it,
she didn’t want his pity. She didn’t want anything from him.
70 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
Carefully, he began to wash her face. She jerked back. He
sighed, cupped the back of her head and went right on washing.
It felt wonderful.
When he was done, she gave him a jerky nod. “Thank you,”
she said stiffly and turned away but, once again, she could see
what he was doing from the corner of her eye. Putting the water
and napkin back in the compartment. Taking out another bottle,
this one filled with an amber liquid. Taking out a crystal tumbler.
Opening the bottle, pouring the liquid into the glass…
“Drink this.”
She swung toward him. Bad idea. Everything began to spin.
The interior of the car, Alex’s face. The glass he was holding
toward her.
“Damn it,” he said, reaching for her, “you’re as white as a sheet.”
“I’m—I’m okay. I’m not going to be sick again. I’m just a
little woozy…”
Alex’s arms swept around her. “Don’t,” she said, but she was
speaking into the hardwall of his chest as he lifted her into his lap.
He was warm. Strong. He smelled of snow and cold and of
the clean male scent she remembered, had never forgotten.
“Let go of me,” she said, and hated how her voice shook but
the truth was, she felt awful. Not sick to her stomach anymore,
just cold and shaky and awful.
“Stop arguing with everything I say and drink this.”
His tone was gruff but he held her with care. Well, of course.
He certainly didn’t want to risk having her throw up all over his
magnificent automobile.
The glass was at her mouth.
“What is it?”
“Poison,” he said, but when she looked up at him, he was
smiling. “It’s brandy.”
“I don’t—”
“Yes. I know. You don’t need brandy. Well, I do.” He took a
drink from the glass, then brought it to her lips again. “For once,
just do as I ask without giving me a tough time, okay?”
The brandy smelled wonderful. She thought of how it would
SANDRA MARTON 71
feel, warm and soothing, and of how his mouth had touched the
rim of the glass…
It was safer to think about doing as he’d commanded.
She did, and knew she’d been right. The brandy was warm
and comforting. So was the man who held her. The thought,
unbidden, unexpected, set her heart racing and she pushed the
glass away.
“That’s enough.And you can let go of me. I’m perfectly fine.”
He answered by gathering her closer. “It’s late,” he said brusquely.
“And I’ve had a long day. I think you have, too. So stop
fighting me, Maria. You’re cold and shaky and I’m not at all convinced
you don’t need a doctor.”
“I already said I didn’t.”
“Then do as you’re told. Finish the brandy, put your head
against my shoulder and maybe, just maybe, I’ll believe you.”
“You’re a—a martinet,” she said bitterly. “Did anyone ever
tell you that?”
It was such an old-fashioned word that it made him laugh.
“I’ve been called a lot of things by a lot of women, glyka mou,
but that is a first.” He sank back in the seat; she had no choice
but to sink back with him. “Now close your eyes and rest. We’ll
be at the airport soon.”
Rest? She’d won a competition that had been the goal of the
world’s best jewelry designers—and handed her life over to one
of theworld’s most gorgeous, sexiest men. Howcould she possibly
rest? Surely, the man holding her had his choice of women, a different
one every night if he wished, and yet he wanted her…
Her lashes drooped.
She couldn’t rest. Or sleep. Or…
Maria sighed, burrowed closer against him, and tumbled
into sleep.
Alex felt the tension leave her. He looked down, saw the dark
shadow of her lashes against the sculpted curve of her cheek.
The woman was impossible. Argumentative. Prickly.
Sharp-tongued.
72 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
She was also beautiful and fragile and…
And, he reminded himself, she was a manipulative liar. The
sooner he had her in his bed, the better. She would not spin lies
to him there; he would not permit it. He would make love to her
until she sobbed his name, until her need for him was real, and
that would happen as soon as he had her, alone, on his plane.
But when they reached it, he carried a still-sleeping Maria
through the big cabin, to the privacy of his bedroom. Sat her on
the edge of the bed. Took off her jacket and her boots. Took off
his jacket and soggy shoes, as well.
Her eyelids fluttered but did not lift. “Alexandros?” she
murmured.
She had called him that the night they’d made love. That was
the only name he’d given her, just ‘Alexandros’. “Alex, if you
prefer,” he’d added, but not the rest.
Not that she’d needed it, he thought grimly. She had known
his identity; she had targeted him.
“Wake up,” he said coldly as he lay her back against the
pillows. She didn’t. He looked at her again. Even in sleep, she
looked exhausted. And incredibly lovely.
He lay downnext to her. Drewthe cashmere throwfrom the foot
of the bed over them both. Maria sighed in her sleep and turned
toward him.What else could he do except gather her into his arms?
SANDRA MARTON 73
CHAPTER SIX
MARIA awoke in total confusion.
Her heart thumped with terror. Where was she?
Everything about this room was wrong. The bed. The faint
light stealing in through the window. Even the feel of the silk
bed linen under her cheek, the whisper-weight of the blanket…
The pillow beside hers. Indented, as if someone’s head had
rested on it. A faint scent. Clean. Crisp. Male.
“Ohmygod,” she whispered, and shot up against the pillows.
A bad move. Her stomach did a slow roll. She bolted from the
bed, looked around wildly, saw the bathroom and barely got
there in time.
She retched until the muscles of her diaphragm ached.
Shaken and shaking, she closed her eyes and sank down on the
cold tile floor.
Easy, she told herself, just take it easy.
Seconds later, she stood, washed her face, unscrewed the top
from a small bottle of mouthwash and rinsed her mouth until the
bottle was empty.
Boneless, on legs that seemed to be made of over-cooked
pasta, she sank down on the closed commode.
She remembered it all. Alex’s arrival. The royal commission.
The awful visit to Luz, the humiliation of being sick afterward…
Most of all, the unbelievable proposition Alex had made—and
she had accepted.
SANDRA MARTON 75
Was this a hotel room?As if in answer, the floor seemed to give
a gentle dip. Not a hotel room. Thiswas his plane. They were somewhere
over the ocean and she couldn’t even remember getting on
board. Her memory took her as far as being sick in the snow. Alex
cradling her in his arms. The warming swallows of brandy.
Maria groaned and buried her face in her hands.
Had she slept with him? No. Heat flooded her body. Definitely,
no. If Alex had made love to her— Correction. If they’d had sex,
she’d remember. Besides, except for her jacket and boots, shewas
still dressed in the ratty outfit she’d worn last night.
Somehow, the thought that she’d slept between silk sheets and
beneath what was probably a cashmere blanket dressed like this
made her want to laugh.
God, she was coming apart! Aches where she’d never had
aches. Laughter that could just as easily turn to tears. Nausea
when she least expected it. Joaquin was right. She’d been
working too hard. Stress could do terrible things.
She rose to her feet. There was a stall shower. A big terrycloth
robe hanging from a hook. Shampoo and soap and—
And Alex, just outside the bedroom door.
How was she going to face him? What was she going to say?
Could she ask him if he’d slept with her? Well, not with her. In
the same bed. Not that it mattered. He had the right. Hadn’t she
agreed to share his bed, and not just for sleep?
It was a miracle he hadn’t held her to that unspoken agreement
already, but then a woman who tossed her cookies at a
man’s feet wasn’t exactly a turn-on. Not that she wanted to turn
him on. Not that she wanted him to undress her, touch her, carry
her to his bed and do more, much more than sleep next to her…
Someone knocked at the door. The knob rattled. Maria swung
around and stared as if it were a live thing about to launch an attack.
“Ms. Santos?” A woman’s voice. “Ms. Santos?”
She took a deep breath. “Yes?”
The door opened. A pleasant-faced woman of about fifty
smiled at her.
“Good morning, Ms. Santos. I’m Thalia. The stewardess. The
prince asked me to tell you we’ll be landing in a couple of hours.
He asks that you join him for breakfast.”
Maria felt her face heat. “Thank you.”
“I’ve left your bag at the foot of the bed.”
Could her cheeks get any hotter? “Fine. Thank you again.”
Thalia smiled, stepped out of the room and shut the door
behind her. Maria flew to it and turned the lock.
How could she face anyone? She’d all but died of humiliation
just now and there were other people to deal with. The pilot.
A co-pilot. Half the kingdom of Aristo, for all she knew. So
what? the logical part of her said. Common sense assured her
that Prince Alexandros had a long tradition of having women
travel with him and share his bed.
The knowledge would come as no shock to anyone.
Yes, but it came as a shock to her. She had never been a
mistress before.
The fact was, she had never been with a man before that
night two months ago. Not that His Royal Arrogance would
believe it if she told him. Not that she would tell him. Her humiliation
was already devastating enough. Why make it worse?
Far better to let him think that she was as experienced as he obviously
believed.
Why hadn’t she thought of that sooner?
Maria stripped off her clothes and stepped into the shower.
Alex had called her a liar. She wasn’t, but she could carry
things off when she had to. Hadn’t she prepped for the interview
at FIT without letting her mother know? And then there’d
been the interview itself, when she’d sat in a waiting room like
an ugly duckling lost in a bevy of swans. And years later, after
she’d won the Caligari prize and approached a buyer at a posh
Fifth Avenue store with a small box filled with earrings of her
own design…
Oh yes, she thought as she tilted her face up to the spray, yes,
she could do this. Pretend that being his sex toy for a month
meant nothing. Not a problem.
Not at all.

76 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
Where in blazes was Maria?
Alex had awakened hours ago.Awakened? His mouth twisted.
Hehad not really slept.Howcould amansleep with awoman curled
against him, her breath warm and light against his throat, her hand
on his chest? Maria had curved her body into his as if she’d belonged
there. He’d told himself it didn’t affect him and it hadn’t…
For about thirty seconds.
Then, he’d gone into a full state of arousal.
He’d imagined rolling her onto her back. Undressing her.
Caressing her. Imagined her waking slowly as she felt his hands
and mouth moving gently on her flesh.
“Alexandros?” she’d have whispered, as she had that night
they’d spent together, as she had just a little while ago, when he’d
put her to bed, and he’d have said, Yes, it’s Alexandros. Say my
name again, Maria. Touch me with your cool hands. Open your
mouth so I can taste your sweetness…
That was when he’d shot from the bed.
A cold shower. A change of clothes. Then he’d left the room
without a backward glance because he hadn’t trusted himself.
He’d waited weeks for this. He wasn’t going to take her now,
when she was exhausted and sick and only half aware of him.
He wanted her wide awake when he possessed her, wanted
her eyes on his as he took what she had only pretended to give
him that first time.
His flight crew, of course, had asked no questions, nor had Thalia
when he’d told her to inform his guest that they’d be landing soon.
“Is Ms. Santos awake?” he’d asked brusquely, when Thalia
brought him coffee.
“Yessir. I gave her your message.”
Alex looked at his watch. Fifteen minutes had gone by. What
was taking her so long? Did she think she could stay locked in
the bedroom? That she could put off what would happen next?
The hell she could.
They’d land soon, his car would be waiting. He would drive
to his apartment in Ellos and take her to his bed.
He looked at his watch again. He was weary of playing her
SANDRA MARTON 77
games. He put down his coffee cup. Blotted his lips with a linen
napkin. There was still time to assert his possession now…
The door at the rear of the cabin opened. Maria stood framed
within it; her eyes met his. He saw her take a breath and then she
started toward him. The ugly sweats and boots had been replaced
by a pale gray long-sleeved sweater that fell to her hips, black
tights and pale gray ankle boots. Her hair, still damp, tumbled
around her shoulders.
His gut tightened. By God, shewas beautiful.And composed.
He had not expected that. The fact was, he wasn’t sure what
he’d expected. Tears, maybe. Pleas that he send her home. He’d
judged wrong. The look on her facewas a study in self-assurance.
“Good morning,” he said, and rose to his feet. He gestured to
the chair opposite his. She took it, plucked the napkin from under
the heavy silverware and spread it in her lap. “How do you feel?”
“I’m fine. I’m sorry about last night—”
“That you slept curled in my arms?”
“That I got sick,” she said quickly, but the tiniest bit of color
crept into her face.
So. Perhaps she wasn’t as self-confident as she appeared.
“I’m just happy a night’s sleep helped. I tried not to disturb
you when I left the bed,” he said, pouring coffee for her. He
glanced at her, to see what effect his deliberate use of the word
‘bed’ had made. None. None at all. Her expression was impersonal
again. “You were curled so tightly in my arms that I had
to disentangle us.”
There it was again. That little rush of color. She shot him a
look, then buried it in a sip of coffee. She swallowed, looked up.
The tip of her tongue peeped out; she swiped it over her lips. To
his annoyance, he felt his body stir.
“I was sure I’d wake you when I took my arm out from around
your shoulders.”
She looked straight at him. “I thought your stewardess said
we’d be landing soon.”
“A change of subject, agapimeni?” His tone was pure silk.
78 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
“Did you want to discuss something other than the fact that you
slept with me last night?”
“We shared the same bed,” she said, looking him straight in the
eye. “I’m sure you know the difference between that and what
people mean when they say they slept together.” Her lips compressed.
“Besides, I didn’t know I rated a change of subject. I
thought mistresses were expected to comply with the wishes of
their masters. That is what I will be, isn’t it?Your mistress? I mean,
isn’t that what one calls a woman who warms a man’s bed?”
Damn it! He was the one who could feel his face filling with
heat. What a hell of a little speech, and had she deliberately
waited until Thalia was in earshot? His stewardess had been
with him for years; if asked, he’d have said nothing could rattle
her but hadn’t her eyebrows just taken a surprised lift?
Alex tossed his napkin on the table and got to his feet.Two could
play at this game of control—but only one would be the winner.
“We’ll be on the ground soon,” he said coldly. “And then
there’ll be plenty of time for me to make my wishes clear—and
for you to make absolutely certain you comply with them.”
The last time Maria had come to Aristo, the only time, had been
in early December, the start of the Mediterranean winter.
The plane had taxied to a jet way; she’d disembarked along
with scores of other travel-weary coach passengers and sleepwalked
through the terminal to a luggage carousel where she’d
waited for her suitcase to thump its way toward her. Then she’d
headed outside and waited in line for a taxi.
Arriving in the kingdom with a prince of the Royal House of
Karedes was very different.
Alex’s jet landed and taxied to an area far from the busy
terminal. Two men wheeled a staircase to the door. The captain
and co-pilot left the cockpit and saluted as she and Alex moved
past them; Thalia dropped a little curtsy toAlex and smiled at her.
“Enjoy your stay, miss.”
Alex slid his arm around her waist. “I’ll see to it Ms. Santos
enjoys every minute.”
SANDRA MARTON 79
Was she the only one who heard the ironic undertone in his
words? She couldn’t tell; Thalia’s face showed nothing but Maria
felt a tinge of heat wash into hers.
No, she told herself fiercely, no! She would not let him take
control again. Determinedly, she shrugged free of his encircling
arm and went down the stairs.
In December, the Aristan skies had been a brilliant blue and the
day unseasonably warm. Now, in early February, the air held a
distinct chill. Just as chillingwas the sight of the uniformed chauffeur
standing at attention beside a black limousine even more
imposing than the one that had ferried them around NewYork.
A shudder went through her, and Alex immediately took off
his leather jacket and wrapped it around her shoulders.
“I don’t need that,” she said, trying to shrug it away, but he
clasped the collar, brought the edges together and, in doing so,
drew her closer.
“But you do, agapimeni,” he said, smiling though the smile
never reached his eyes. “Besides, didn’t you just tell me the first
rule a mistress must follow is compliance?”
“Don’t count your chickens before they hatch,” Maria said
coolly. “I’m not your mistress yet.”
His eyes grew darker than midnight.
“You will be, glyka mou,” he said huskily. “And very soon.”
He brushed a strand of hair from her cheek and hooked it
behind her ear. His gaze fell to her lips. Was he going to kiss her,
despite the people watching from the top of the stairs and the
chauffeur waiting beside the car?
If he did—if he did, she would stand straight and still within
his arms and give him nothing in return.
“Did you hear what I said, Maria? An hour from now, you’ll
be in my bed.”
Her pulse rocketed. It took all her strength to respond with
what she hoped was a cool smile.
“Thank you for the warning, Your Highness. It’s always
helpful to be prepared for something unpleasant.”
To her amazement, Alex laughed.
80 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
“Very nicely done.” His hands swept into her hair and he tilted
her face to his. “But a sad little lie.” His smile faded. “Tell me
how unpleasant it is after I have you undressed,” he whispered.
“Say it when my mouth is at your breast, when it is between your
thighs. Tell me then, glyka mou, and I might just believe you.”
She felt her nipples peak, felt the swift rush of desire spear
low in her belly. He seemed to know what effect his words had
because he bent his head and gave her a quick, possessive kiss.
“Get in the car, agapi mou,” he said, and the look of satisfaction
on his hard, beautiful face made her wonder who she hated
the most, Alex or herself.
The car moved swiftly through the streets of Ellos.
Alex was on his cell phone, talking softly as buildings flashed
by. She recognized the small hotel she’d stayed at, the busy street
where she’d first met him. The romantic restaurant he’d taken her
to, the little park where he’d kissed her.
He’d told the truth, she thought, and drew a shaky breath. He’d
have her in his bed very soon. His apartment was only a couple
of blocks away.
But the car didn’t take the turn that would have brought
them there.
Where was he taking her, then?
She threw him a glance. He’d put the phone away; he sat with
his arms folded over his chest, looking distant and formidable,
and she decided she’d sooner die than ask. Besides, what did it
matter? Maybe he had rules for this kind of thing. Or maybe he
didn’t want her in his apartment. Maybe there was another
woman there already. Or maybe he preferred to keep his women
in a hotel.
The limo swooped up a ramp and onto a highway. A sign in
both Greek and English flashed by.
To the North Coast Beaches and the Bay of Apollonia.
Beaches? Bays? Shewas a city girl. Streets, noise, traffic were
her natural habitat. Beaches and bays sounded foreign. Isolated.
“Aren’t we going to your apartment?”
SANDRA MARTON 81
She spoke without thinking, regretted it almost immediately,
but Alex had a ready reply.
“We were, but I changed my mind. I’m taking you to a place
where your compliance will be assured.”
Her heart skipped a beat. She thought of telling him he wasn’t
funny but that would be a sign of surrender, and the last thing
this man would have from her was surrender.
Her refusal to bend to his will was all she had left, and she
was intent on keeping it.
The drive took what seemed a very long time.
They had reached the bay; the sign at the exit said so but the
proof was in the spectacular view from a road that now hugged
high, curving cliffs above sand so white it looked as if it were
made of crushed pearls. Beyond that stretched a sea of deep, brilliant
blue, so beautiful it took her breath away.
All right. She had to break her self-imposed silence.
“Is that the Bay of Apollonia?”
Alex nodded. “Named for the god, Apollo. Legend says that
Virgil wrote a poem about this place some two thousand years ago.”
“Virgil? But he was Roman.”
“Aristo and its sister island, Calista, were first part of the
Greek Empire and then were ruled by Rome. You’re familiar
with Virgil?”
Maria stiffened. “I might not have had your tutors and private
schools, Alexandros, but the New York City schools provided me
with an excellent education.”
“I didn’t mean to imply…”
“Yes. You did. You don’t know a thing about me but you have
no trouble jumping to all kinds of conclusions.”
“I might say the same of you, glyka mou.”
Maria looked at him. “You mean,” she said sweetly, “you
didn’t have tutors? You didn’t go to private schools?”
“Well, no. I mean, I did—but I have to admit, I tuned out most
of what I learned in Latin III, whichwas pretty much when we dealt
withVirgil. I guess I’m just surprised you didn’t do the same.”
82 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
He grinned, and it instantly transformed him from cold despot
to the gorgeous, easygoing man she’d met that night two months
ago. She didn’t want that. Didn’t want to remember that night,
how he’d made her feel when he’d made love to her.
“Anyway, yes, Virgil wrote about the Bay of Apollonia. He
called it an ambrosial sea of sapphire.”
How could she not reply to that? Maria sighed and gazed out
at the bay again.
“He was right,” she said softly, “though I’ve never seen a
sapphire that magnificent. But if I did—”
“If you did?”
“I’d use it as the center stone in a ring. I’d make the setting
of twenty-four-karat gold to suggest the brilliance of the sun, and
mount the sapphire between a pair of small, perfect diamonds to
represent the sister islands of Aristo and Calista.”
“They’re not that anymore,” Alex said, a bit grimly. “The
unified kingdom of Adamas is just a memory until, if and when
the islands are somehow reunited.”
“Is that what people hope will happen?”
“It’s what King Christos hoped would happen when he gave
dominion of one island to his daughter, Anya, and the other to
my father, Aegeus.”
“Was that when Christos had the Stefani diamond split in two?”
Alex raised an eyebrow. “You’ve done your homework.”
“Did you think I designed the necklace for your mother out
of nothing? Of course I did my homework. I know the diamond
was the biggest pink diamond ever mined on Calista, that it dates
to the time of Richard the Lionheart and that it was the center of
the crown of Adamas until it was cut in half in ninety seventyfour.”
Maria flushed. “I don’t know why I’m telling you all this
when you already know it.”
The lady was full of surprise, Alex thought, watching her in
silence for a little while. Then he cleared his throat.
“What will you do with the money from the commission?”
“What will I do with it?” Her disbelieving tone suggested he’d
lost his mind.
SANDRA MARTON 83
“Yes. Surely, it’s enough to buy the perfect sapphire, the
perfect diamonds—”
“You mean, it’s enough to put a down payment on my loft.
Buy some new equipment. Pay some overdue bills. Pay some
bills for my mother, maybe even convince her to move to a nicer
place.” She gave a rueful laugh. “That’s what I’ll do with the
commission.”
“You support your mother?”
Maria gave a little shrug. “She isn’t up to working.”
“Surely, she could—”
“She doesn’t think so. And I owe her. She sacrificed everything
for me…”
“You can’t really believe that,” he said, a touch of anger in
his words.
“What does it matter? I do what must be done, Your Highness,
the same as most people, but what would you know about that,
in your world?”
“That’s unfair.”
“Is it?” Her lips stretched in a smile. “You show up at my door.
You give me the most wonderful news imaginable.”
“And that’s bad?”
“Then you tell me the only way this—this miracle will happen
is if I agree to sleep with you.”
His eyes narrowed. “Trying to get out of our deal, Maria?” He
moved quickly, covered the distance between them and caught
her by the elbows. “All I did was turn the tables,” he said in a low
voice. “You set the trap the first time. Now it’s my turn.”
Maria could feel the sting of angry tears. She didn’t want to
cry in front of him!
“Let go of me.”
“Why? Because you don’t like the truth?”
“You wouldn’t know the truth if it bit you! There was no trap!
You seduced me.”
“I seduced you the way a chicken seduces a fox! You were
good, I have to admit. I really believed you were a shy Miss
Innocent lost on the streets of a strange city.”
84 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
“Bastardo!” Maria hissed.
Alex slid his hands to her wrists, clamped them hard and
dragged her toward him.
“You knew who I was. You intended to use me.” His eyes
narrowed. “Now I’m going to use you.”
He bent his head and took her mouth, his kiss hard and demanding
and she hated him, hated the touch of his hands, the feel
of his mouth. Hated, hated, hated…and then she stopped thinking
and fell into the kiss.
He felt it happen. Knew the moment she let go—and then his
arms were around her, she was in his lap, his hand was under her
sweater, his mouth was feeding on hers and it was as it had been
that night, the hot need, the drowning passion, the desire to take
and take and never let her go…
His cell phone rang.
Slowly, Alex came back to the world. The car had stopped.
He cupped Maria’s shoulders, put her from him. Her eyes opened
slowly; he saw in them everything he’d seen that night. Surprise.
Desire. Even the innocence he damned well knew wasn’t real.
Angrily, he yanked the phone from his pocket and flipped it open.
“Alexandros? Are you there?”
His father’s voice buzzed in his ear. “Ne,” he said, clearing his
throat.Aegeus talked.Alex listened.Yes, he said again, yes, all right.
But his eyes never left Maria’s face. The way she was looking
at him, the way her lips were parted. He wanted to reach for her
when the call ended. She knew it; he could see it, feel it. She was
ready for him. God, yes, she was ready.
But hewasn’t a fool. Hewould be in control this time, not she.
The Mercedes slowed. Ahead, elaborate wrought-iron
security gates swung slowly open. The car moved under a long
archway of tall cedars and came to a stop in a circular drive
before a magnificent glass and cedar mansion.
“Where are we?” Maria said warily.
“Bluebeard’s castle,” Alex said wryly. “My home, Maria.
My housekeeper expects you. Go inside. See if everything is
as you wish.”

“I don’t under—”
“There’s been a change of plans. I have work to do. I’ll be
back this evening. Six o’clock. We have a dinner appointment.
Be ready. I do not like to be kept waiting.”
The commands were flung at her like stones from a slingshot.
Maria lifted her chin and glared.
“I have no interest in playing games, Your Highness, or going
on pretend dates.”
A smile spread across his lips. “In such a hurry to get to bed,
glyka mou?” Her cheeks colored and he gave the kind of laugh
she knew she would never forget. “It’s hardly a date,” he said
brusquely. “My parents want to meet the winner of the royal commission.”
He wrapped his hand around the back of her neck, drew
her to him and kissed her, hard and deep. “One final reprieve,
agapimeni, and then, rest assured, you will share my bed.”
CHAPTER SEVEN
ALEX’S driver deposited Maria’s suitcase beside her, saluted
briskly and strode back to the limousine.
Wait, Maria almost said, but what would be the point? There
was something intimidating about being delivered to the massive
front doors of a mansion where she knew no one, but getting back
into the car beside a man who’d just kissed her senseless wasn’t
much of an alternative.
She could hear the purr of the big car’s engine as it went
down the drive. She took a deep breath, raised a hand toward
the bell. The doors swung open before she could touch it and a
small woman dressed head to toe in crisp black cotton stood
looking at her.
Wonderful. This had to be the housekeeper. Did she bear
more than a passing resemblance to the one in that old movie
about Young Frankenstein? Then the woman smiled, dipped a
knee, and was instantly transformed from wicked witch to a welcoming
committee of one.
“Kalimera, Keeria. Onomázome Athenia.”
“I’m afraid I don’t speak Greek—”
“Of course. Forgive me. Good morning, madam, and
welcome. I am Athenia. The prince has told me to make sure you
are comfortable.”
Did he leave the same orders for all his mistresses?
“Thank you.”
88 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
Athenia clapped her hands. A manservant appeared, inclined
his head to Maria and scooped up her suitcase.
“Really,” Maria said, with a little laugh, “no one has to bow
to me. I’m not a royal or anything like that.”
“You are the prince’s guest and the lady who is to create a
beautiful gift for our beloved queen. We are honored by your
presence, keeria.” The housekeeper stepped back. “Please, won’t
you come in?”
What would happen to Athenia’s warm welcome if she knew
that Alex’s esteemed guest had also made a devil’s bargain with
him? There was no sense in thinking about it. She was here, and
she would do what had to be done.
“Thank you,” Maria said again, and stepped into a cool, slatefloored
entryway. One quick glance assured her this house would
never be confused with Bluebeard’s castle.
“Would you like something to drink? Something to eat? I
know you have had a long journey.”
Just the mention of food and Maria’s belly did a nasty little
flip-flop.
“No,” she said quickly, “no, thank you. I’m not hungry.”
“Then,would you like me to showyou to your room?”Athenia
nodded toward a spiraling staircase that seemed suspended in the
air. “Or would you prefer to see your workshop first?”
Her room? What the housekeeper meant was the prince’s
room. Unbidden, a tremor of what surely had to be apprehension
danced along Maria’s skin.
“Uh, no,” she said, a little breathlessly. “I mean…I mean, my
workshop will be here?”
“It will. I hope you will like it. His Highness gave very
specific orders but we had so little time…”
The Prince of Arrogance’s specialty, Maria thought grimly.
Handing out orders. Giving people little time to obey, much less
question. And why would she be working here? What had he
done? Put a bench in the basement? Hung a work light over it?
She’d have everything she needed, he’d said.
“If you would please come this way…?”

Maria followed the housekeeper through a series of magnificent,
high-ceilinged rooms. Despite her irritation, the artist in her
could not help but see the house’s incredible beauty.
The lifestyles of the rich and famous, she thought wryly.
Always and forever amazing.
She knew how they lived. She was a NewYorker; her life and
those of the fantastically wealthy were completely separate but,
in Manhattan, you brushed shoulders all the time even if it was
only at the Bobbi Brown counter at Saks. And if you knew
somebody who knewsomebody who knewsomebody who could
get you into a promotional party for Vogue or Vanity Fair—and
she did—you could even get up-close-and-personal glimpses of
that kind of storied existence. An old classmate from FIT, a guy
who now designed incredible floral displays, had edged her onto
a couple of those guest lists, though attending the parties had
never snagged her a client.
Still, nothing she’d seen compared to this.
Maria tried not to stare as she followedAthenia throughAlex’s
home. The mansion was spectacular but she had to give him
grudging credit. It had not been built to impress, though it surely
did, but to celebrate thewooded setting, the sapphire bay, the white
sand beach.Walls were made of glass. Almost all the rooms had
terraces or balconies, and the water from an enormous infinity
pool seemed to spill into a sea that stretched to the horizon.
Athenia led her out a pair of glass French doors. Apparently,
her workshop was not in the house. Maybe the mighty prince
thought she could make his mother’s birthday gift in the garage,
Maria thought irritably as they made their way along a flagstone
path that wound through a dormant garden.
The housekeeper turned to her and smiled.
“Your workshop, keeria.”
Maria blinked in surprise.
Ahead, in a grove of firs, stood a perfect miniature of the main
house. Wood. Glass. Soaring rooflines, terraces, white sand and
blue water a dizzying distance below.
“This is normally a guesthouse but the prince was very
specific about your needs. We worked quickly to meet them, but
if anything is not to your liking…”
Not to her liking? Maria almost laughed as they stepped inside.
The guesthouse had three rooms. A bedroom. A marble
bathroom. And a main room, big and high-ceilinged and brightly
lit, a room that had been filled with oak worktables and benches,
with shelves that held tools she had dreamed of buying but only
in a distant, far more affluent future. A quick glance revealed
heated presses, torches, hand tools and protective gear, all of it
straight out of a jewelry maker’s dreams.
And there were cabinets.
Cabinets with drawers and cubby-holes and shelves. Cabinets
that opened to reveal all the things she could possibly need to
create Queen Tia’s necklace. Waxes. Molds. Polishes. Trays of
bright gold and platinum and silver.
And one special tray that made her heartbeat quicken.
“Shall I leave you here, miss?” Athenia said.
Maria nodded. And reached for that special tray. Lined in
black silk, its small compartments burned with the fire of the brilliant
white and pink diamonds she had so carefully described in
her proposal as the only ones suitable for the queen’s gift.
The stones glittered with life.
Carefully matched white diamonds from a mine in the
Canadian Yukon, where there was no danger of them having
been involved in the blood conflicts of the world. And two magnificent
pink diamonds, so exquisite they could only be from the
fabulous mines of Calista.
Maria lifted the pink stones from their silken compartments.
She would only use one as the centerpiece of the necklace. In
her proposal, she’d pointed out that pink diamonds, that all
diamonds, had slight differences in color.
Obviously, King Aegeus had decided to provide her with two
stones so she could choose the one she preferred. The implications
of such wealth were almost beyond comprehension.
The pinks were easily forty karats each, just as she had requested.
She had determined the size she’d need by estimating
90 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
that the Stefani diamond, in its original form, was said to have
weighed approximately one hundred and ninety carats, meaning
it had been even bigger than the fabled Darya-ye Noor, a pale
pink diamond that had been mined in India hundreds of years ago
and then became part of the Persian crown jewels.
Thus, the half of the Stefani pink diamond now in the Aristan
crown would weigh somewhere around eighty carats, since some
material would have been lost when the stone was split. The pink
diamond that would be the focal point in the queen’s necklace
would have to be of a size to complement the one in the crown.
These incredible pink ovals would look the same to the untrained
eye, but Maria could see a slight variation in color. The
only way to choose the proper stone for the queen’s necklace
would be to check both against the pink diamond in the crown.
The palace had provided her with photos of it but no photo could
capture the soul of a diamond, or the subtleties of its color, especially
when it was half of the legendary Stefani stone.
Carefully, she returned the pink diamonds to their tray. Her
design couldn’t be changed now, nor did she want to change it, but
diamonds, born in the extreme pressure and heat of the earth’s
forming crust millions of years ago, all had their own characteristics.
Her plans needed simple refining. Nothing anyone but she
would notice.Afiligree of gold here, a millimeter less in depth there.
First, though, she had to call Joaquin and Sela and let them know
she was all right. She hadn’t had the chance to do it last night…
Better not to think about that.
She used her cell phone, left a brief message about the commission
on their voice mail, with no mention of the very personal
contract terms that involved the prince.
“I’m very happy,” she said. And, at the moment, that was the
