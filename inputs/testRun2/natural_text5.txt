CHAPTER ONE
PRINCEALEXANDROS KAREDES, second in line to the throne of the
Kingdom of Aristo, did not like to be kept waiting.
Indeed, he never was.
Whowould be so foolish as to let a man like him cool his heels?
His own father, Alexandros thought with a sigh of resignation
as he strode past the marble fireplace outside the throne room for
what had to be the tenth time in as many minutes. The hands on
the French ormolu clock that graced the mantel stood upright at
six.Alexandros had been told the kingwould see him at five-thirty
butAegeuswas not known for promptness, even with his children.
“An unfortunate habit,” Queen Tia called it, but Alex was not
as kind. He knew his father well; he was certain Aegeus’s chronic
lateness was yet another subtle way of reminding everyone,
family included, that, though he was getting on in years, he was
still king.
It was undoubtedly the same reason he’d asked Alex to meet
him here, in such formal surroundings, rather than in the privacy
of the royal apartments.
That was just the way it was. There was no point in questioning
it. Aegeus was a more than competent ruler. He led the people
of Aristo well but he had always been distant in his dealings with
his wife, sons and daughters.
Alex had no objection. At six or seven, a display of affection,
a lessening of formalities might have meant something, but he
8 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
was thirty-one now, he had created his own eminently successful
life by bringing ever-increasing international recognition and
resources to the kingdom.
He had no need for signs of affection from his father. Affection
was for puppies and kittens, not grown men.
Alexandros glanced at the clock again.
Even though he understood the reason for it, being kept
waiting was irritating. And inconvenient. The meeting with his
father would not take long. He knew that from past experience.
He’d just returned from a business trip to the Far East. Aegeus
would simplywant to knowif things had gone well, if newbanks
and corporations would be joining the impressive list of those
already on Aristo, but he would not wish to hear the details.
Results were all that mattered, was Aegeus’s motto. How one
got to those results was immaterial.
That was okay with Alex. He didn’t need pats on the back any
more than he needed signs of affection. Itwas only that if the king
kept him waiting much longer, he’d be late getting into town.
Not that it mattered.
His new Ferrari would easily conquer the narrow roads that
wound along the cliffs looming above the Mediterranean. And
even if he arrived at The Grand Hotel in Ellos past the time he’d
told his date he’d pick her up, she would not complain.
A little smile lifted the corners of his lips.
Why be unduly modest? He did well with all the things he
most enjoyed. Beautiful women, fast cars, baccarat, the vast
business empire he’d created here and in New York.
His smile faded.
Actually, he had not done as well with women lately.
Not that they weren’t his for the taking. The woman waiting
for him tonight was what the world called a supermodel. Simone
had been doing a Vogue cover shoot outside the casino just as
Alex had arrived to discuss the casino’s expansion with its
manager, but that had not kept him from pausing to admire the
leggy blonde posing on the wide marble steps, dressed in a silk
gown that clung like a second skin.

Their eyes had met. Alex had grinned and without hesitation
she’d come down the steps, hips swaying thanks to heels so high
they seemed to be made for sin, oblivious to the frenzied ‘Hey!’
of the photographer.
“Hello,” she’d cooed when she had reached him, smiling the
smile that was worth ten thousand dollars an hour to an advertiser.
“I’m free this evening, Your Highness, and I certainly hope
that you are, too.”
He’d said he was leaving for Tokyo but he’d be back in three
days. “Call me,” she’d purred, and he had, first thing this
morning. What man wouldn’t? She was stunning. Sexy as hell.
He knew she’d be in his bed at the apartment he kept in town
before the night ended…
So what?
A crazy thought. But there it was. A gorgeous woman, another
hot liaison and all he could think was, So what? He’d have the
model and, come morning, she’d be looking for a way to turn a
night into an affair.
He’d be looking for a polite way to make it clear he wasn’t
interested.
Lately, ending an affair before it really had time to start had
become a pattern. He liked sex. Liked women. Their feel, their
scent, their company. It was just that he couldn’t seem to concentrate
on any one woman lately. For weeks now, he’d drifted
from one to another.
He knewdamned well there were men who’d find that exciting.
He didn’t.
Not that he believed in long-term affairs. A month. Two.
Three, that was about it and then he’d do the right thing, send an
incredibly expensive gift and move on.
Alex frowned.
The past couple of months, the only part of that familiar plan
he seemed to get right was the part about moving on.
His brothers had noticed. They’d taken to teasing him about
what they called his wanderlust. With the emphasis on ‘lust,’
Sebastian said, while Andreas grinned. Even his sisters got in on
10 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
the act, Lissa long-distance from Paris, Kitty sighing dramatically
and saying, Poor Alex. He just can’t find a woman to love.
Well, no. He wasn’t about to explain the difference between
love and lust to either of them but, of course, love had nothing
to do with it. Why would it? Love was one of those things people
talked about that didn’t really exist.
Myths. Myths as creative as any of the tall tales his long-ago
Greek and Roman ancestors had believed.
What people called ‘love’ was hormonal nonsense—though
he couldn’t call what had drawn his parents together hormonal.
They had come together because it was necessary. Carrying on
a name, a bloodline that had existed for centuries was in the
destiny of royals.
It would surely be the same for Sebastian, heir to the throne,
when the time came. Sebastianwould get to choose his ownwife—
thiswas the twenty-first century, after all—but hewould make that
choice from a carefully vetted list of acceptable young women.
Alex, second in line, would be under somewhat less pressure
but he knew the responsibility of marriage to an appropriate
bride, then children to bear his name, was in his future. It was
all part of his duty to the house of Karedes.
He would demand only that his future wife be attractive.
Beyond that, he had no expectations. Companionship, passion—
those things he would find in a mistress. He would be discreet;
he would never deliberately do anything to insult the woman he
married but a royal wife would understand that her role was to
bear him children.
Neither of them would be foolish enough to look for love.
Discretion in their extra-marital affairs would be enough.
Alex stopped pacing, jammed his hands into his trouser
pockets and stared at the coat of arms on the wall over the
enormous fireplace.
There had been a woman once, years ago. A girl, really. He’d
thought—never mind what he’d thought. What mattered was
what she had thought, that she could use her kisses, her touch,
her soft whispers to bewitch him. He’d been a boy then, led
SANDRA MARTON 11
around by a part of his anatomy that had nothing to do with his
brain, but he’d learned the truth about her in time and had been
wiser for it.
Since then, he had not let a woman lure him into complacency.
Into forgetting that a man always had to look beyond a beautiful
face to see a woman’s true agenda…
Until that night two months ago.
A night when a stranger had stepped into his arms, her face
radiant with seeming innocence. She’d lifted her mouth to his,
parted her lips to the whisper of his breath, the thrust of his
tongue and the world had blurred—until the next morning, when
he’d learned it had all been a lie.
“Prince Alexandros.”
Not just a lie. Alex’s jaw tightened. A scam. A fraud. A
swindle of the first magnitude, and he had fallen for it.
“Sir? The king and queen ask that you join them.”
But she hadn’t gotten away with it. Instead, he’d pretended
he knew nothing of her deception. She had played a part; in the
harsh light of day, it had been his turn to play one, too.
He’d taken her back to bed. Had sex with her again. And that
time, when it was over and she lay sated beneath him, he’d
watched her eyes fill with shock as he told her he knew who she
was, what she was, and promised her that all that would come
of her despicable game was defeat.
Then he’d sent her packing.
The incident had meant so little to him that he could not even
remember her name. Despite her wiles, he’d been the victor.
He’d had hours of sex that had seemed incredible, though he
knew now it had only been, well, sex. And the moment of sweet
revenge that followed had made everything right.
“Your Highness? Their majesties will see you now.”
Or had it?
It wasn’t just women he’d had a lot of these past weeks; it was
everything. He’d put endless miles on the royal private jets with
business trips from his offices in New York and Aristo to
Bermuda. To the Bahamas. To the Virgin Islands, to Florida, to
12 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
Mexico and, most recently, Japan. Successful trips, all of them,
but he’d set one hell of a pace. Meetings by day; by night, the
baccarat tables, high-stakes poker…
And sex.
Was it possible he’d spent the last weeks going from country
to country, bed to bed, trying to wipe away the ugly memories
of a night when he’d come as close as a man could to letting a
woman use him?
“Sir. The king and queen are waiting for you.”
Alex blinked. Galen, his father’s major-domo, stood at stiff
attention before him. From the expression on his face, he’d been
there a while.
“Thank you, Galen. Efcharisto.”
“Are you well, sir?”
“Yes, yes, I’m fine. A little distracted.” Alex forced a grin.
“There’s a lady waiting for me in town.You know how that is.”
Galen permitted himself a small smile. “I am sure the lady is
happy to wait, sir,” he said, and stepped aside with a deep bow
as Alex walked past him into the throne room.
His parents were not alone.
A handful of aides hovered around his father, who was seated
at an antique desk liberally strewn with sheets of paper. His
mother stood on the throne platform, encircled by several of her
ladies-in-waiting who held lengths of silk brocade against her
while a seamstress sat on the floor, pinning and tucking and
doing whatever in heaven’s name women did with all those yards
and yards of fabric.
Alex’s lips twitched.
Despite its elegance, the frescoes, the ceiling painted by a sixteenth-
century master and a wall hung with exquisite Byzantine
icons, right now the room looked more like someone’s slightly
messy sitting room than a place in which the kingdom’s most
formal ceremonies were held.
His father looked up. “There you are,” he said in a tone that
suggested it was he who’d been kept waiting. “Well, what do
you think?”
SANDRA MARTON 13
Alex raised his eyebrows. “About what?”
“About these plans, of course.” Aegeus slapped a hand on the
papers spread over his desk. “Do wewant a theme, or do we not?”
No, Alex thought, this was not someone’s sitting room, this
was more like the Mad Hatter’s tea party.
“A theme for what?” he said carefully.
Aegeus shot to his feet, scattering the aides crowded around him.
“For your mother’s sixtieth birthday celebration, of course!
If you hadn’t spent the last month doing God knows what, you’d
know what was going on here!”
“Now, Aegeus.” Husband and son looked at the queen, who
smiled at them both. “You know Alexandros has been busy convincing
foreigners that our kingdom is the perfect place for them
to invest in the future. And I’m sure we can assume he’s been
successful. Haven’t you, Alex?”
Alex smiled and went to his mother. She bent toward him and
he took her hand and brought it to his lips.
“Mother. I’ve missed you.”
“How was your trip?”
“It was fine.” Alex smiled. “We snared a lot of foreigners who
look forward to a happy future.”
His mother laughed. “You see, Aegeus? It’s just as I said.” Tia
waved the women away and came gracefully down the steps. “It’s
good to have you home again, Alexandros.”
“It’s good to be here.” Alex nodded at the women gathering
up the fabrics. “What’s all this?”
“I just told you what it is,” Aegeus said with impatience.
“Preparation for your mother’s birthday celebration. I thought we
should make the final selections of décor, color and fabric here
in the throne room, where the most formal part of the ceremony
will take place. Isn’t that right, gentlemen?”
The aides nodded.
“We want to be certain everything comes together properly.”
Aegeus looked at his aides, who nodded again. Alex thought
of turkeys pecking for grain at the feet of the farmer who owned
them and repressed a smile.
14 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
“So, what do you think, Alexandros? What theme shall we
use? Our history as part of the ancient world? A link to the days
of the Crusades? The time of the Ottoman Empire? All those
things, as you well know, are in our bloodline.”
Who gave a damn? What mattered was the celebration of his
mother’s sixtieth birthday, not his father’s lineage.
“Any of those would be fine,” Alex said smoothly, with a
quick glance at his mother. “Something big and splashy. After
all, we don’t want it said that only the Calistans can do parties
that are showy.”
He saw his mother bite back a smile.Any mention of Calista,
which had once been part of the Adamas empire along with
Aristo, was enough to make his father’s hackles rise.
“Showy,” Aegeus said, frowning.
“Exactly.” Alex shook his head. “I’ve never understood why
there was so much coverage of the Queen of England’s birthday
celebration a couple of years ago when it was all so low-key.
Have you, Mother?”
“No,” Tia said with perfect innocence, “I’ve never understood
it, either. All those reporters and television people, theworldwide
interest in Elizabeth and the British royals…and all of it done,
as you say, Alexandros, with such quiet elegance.”
The king snorted. “What is there to understand? One either
knows the virtue of simplicity or one doesn’t.” He looked down
at the papers on his desk, studied them for a long moment, then
swept them to the floor with his hand. “I have just chosen a theme
for your birthday celebration, Tia. The coming of spring. I can
envision it now. Masses of early spring flowers. The Venetian
dinnerware in shades of palest green and yellow. And you, the
queen, dressed in a gown the same pale pink as the diamond in
the Aristan crown.”
Thank you, Tia mouthed to her son. Alex flashed her a grin.
“That sounds very nice,” she said demurely.
“Nice? It will be magnificent, especially with you resplendent
in the new necklace I’ll commission as your birthday gift.
Although we could add a brooch…”
SANDRA MARTON 15
“No brooch,” the queen said. “It would be inappropriate,
Aegeus, to wear both a brooch and a necklace.”
The king waved his hand. “Whatever. Take it up with the
craftsman.”
“The jewelry designer,” Tia commented. “That’s what she is.”
She? Alex frowned and thought back to the weekend the final
half-dozen jewelry designers, selected from all around the globe,
had been invited to Aristo to meet with his parents. Had there been
another woman in the group? He only recalled one.
But then, he thought grimly, that had been the plan, hadn’t it?
That the prince who might influence the choice of designer
should have been so bewitched he would notice only one?
Besides, what did his father mean by talking about the
necklace he would commission? The commission had been made
weeks before.
“—don’t you agree, Alexandros?”
Alex looked at his father. “Sorry, Father. I missed that.”
“I said, it doesn’t matter what this woman is called. Designer,
artisan, craftsman—craftswoman,” the king amended, with a nod
to his wife. “She simply must understand the importance of this
commission… And why are all the rest of you still hanging
about?” Aegeus clapped his hands and the seamstress, aides and
ladies-in-waiting scurried from the room. “She must understand
that, Tia. That is a given.”
The queen nodded. “I am certain that she will.”
“I hope you’re right. She seemed very young to me.”
Things were becoming more confusing. His parents were
definitely referring to a woman designer. A young designer…
Alex stiffened.
No. They couldn’t be talking about her. About Maria Santos
and, yes, he damned well did remember her name. How could
he not? A man who was marked to be the gullible victim of a
scam didn’t forget the person who’d been the scammer.
“She couldn’t have seemed anything to you, Aegeus,” Tia
said, with a little smile. “Remember? We never had the pleasure
of meeting her. She sent us a note and explained she’d been
16 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
taken ill that morning. But, of course, we already had seen Miss
Santos’s sketches, and—”
A fist seemed to clench Alex’s gut. He took a deep breath and
forced himself to speak calmly. “Maria Santos? But you said the
commission went to a French company.”
“It did, but they just notified us that the owner passed away
and left the firm tied up in all kinds of unpleasant litigation.” Tia
took Alex’s arm. “I know. It’s all very last minute, and Miss
Santos doesn’t even know that we’re going to ask her to implement
her design.”
“That’s why your trip to New York has such urgency,
Alexandros.”
Alex stared at his father. “What trip to New York?”
“You will see the Santoswoman and inform her of our decision.”
“What your father means,” Queen Tia said, “is that you’ll
explain what’s happened and ask Miss Santos if she will be
generous enough to take on the job at such short notice.”
Another snort from the king. “She’ll leap at the chance.”
“But she might not,” the queen said softly. “This is very last
minute. And true artists have tender egos. Miss Santos may not
like thinking of herself as second choice.”
Alex wanted to laugh. A tender ego? He’d bet Maria Santos
had an ego that could dent cast iron.
“You’re the diplomat in the family,” the king said briskly.
“All that talking and contracting with the businesses you’ve lured
to our island over the years…”
It was as close to a compliment as his father had ever offered
but it wasn’t enough to make Alex go to Maria Santos and present
her with the chance of a lifetime.
“Iwould be happy to help,”Alex said briskly, “but I have pressing
commitments here on the island. Surely someone else can—”
“Someone else cannot,” Aegeus retorted. “You have offices
and an apartment in New York. You know the city. You know its
tempo, its attitude. You’ll be better able to work with the Santos
woman and ensure the necklace is ready in time.”
So much for compliments. This was a royal command. That
SANDRA MARTON 17
the woman who’d wanted this job badly enough to damned near
sell herself to secure it would now get it by default, that he would
be the man who’d have to offer it to her, was almost too ironic
to believe.
“There were other designs submitted,” he said. “Surely one
of them would do?”
His mother’s small hand tightened on his arm. “I preferred
Miss Santos’s work from the beginning, Alex. I deferred to your
father when he selected the French firm, of course, but now…”
Alex looked at the queen as her words trailed away. He knew
it would take little for his father to tell her he had decided on a
different designer. Tia was as restrained as Aegeus was quicktempered,
as gentle as the king was stern. He’d always had the
feeling his mother’s life was not quite the life she had hoped for.
Growing up, he’d spent little time at her side. Boarding school,
tutors, the expected rigor of life as a king’s son had seen to that,
but he loved her deeply none the less. And if a birthday gift
designed by Maria Santos was what she wanted…
“Alexandros?” Tia said softly. “Do you think I’m making
a mistake?”
Alex put his arm around his mother’s shoulders and hugged her.
“What I think is that you should have precisely what you
want on your birthday.”
His mother beamed. “Thank you.”
“Thank me, you mean,” the king said briskly, and gave his
wife what passed for a loving smile. “I’m the one commissioning
your gift.”
The queen laughed. She rose on her toes and kissed her son’s
cheek, then reached for her husband’s hand.
“Thank you both,” she said. “How’s that?”
“It’s fine,” Alex replied.
And that was what he kept telling himself, that it would be
fine, during the seemingly endless flight all the way from Aristo
to New York.
CHAPTER TWO
EVERYTHING was going to be fine.
Absolutely fine, Maria told herself wearily as the Lexington
Avenue local rumbled to a stop at the Spring Street subway station.
Never mind that the man next to her smelled like a skillet of
sautéing garlic. Forget that her feet were shrieking after a day
strapped into gorgeous-but-impossible Manolo stilettos. Pretend
the rain that had become sleet hadn’t turned her sleek, three
hundred dollar Chez Panache blow-out right back into her usual
tumble of coffee-colored wild curls, or that she was obviously
coming down with the flu or something suspiciously like it.
Oh, yes, everything was going to be fine.
And if it wasn’t…if it wasn’t…
The train gave a lurch as it left the station. Garlic Man fell
into her, Maria stumbled sideways and felt one of her sky-high
heels give way.
A word sprang to her lips. It was a word ladies didn’t use, even
if they knew how to say it in Spanish as well as English. Not that
Maria felt much like a lady right now. Still, she bit back the word,
instead visualized it in big neon letters and decided that trying
to figure a way to find the lost heel on the floor of the packed
subway car was something only a madwoman would attempt.
Goodbye, Manolo Blahniks. Goodbye, Chez Panache.
Goodbye, Jewels by Maria.
No. Absolutely, no. She was not going to think like that. What
was it she’d learned in that stress reduction class? Okay, she
hadn’t taken the class, not exactly; there was no time for anything
like taking classes in her life but she’d read the course description
in The New School catalog…
Live in the now.
That was it. Reduce stress by learning to live in the now. At
the moment, that meant—damn!—that meant the train was
pulling into Canal Street.
“Excuse me. Sorry. Coming through!”
She pushed her way through the rush-hour crowd, reached the
doors just as they began to shut and hurled herself onto the
platform. The doors closed; the train started. People surged
toward the stairs, carrying a hobbling Maria in their midst.
Climbing the steps to the street with one shoe now four inches
shorter than the other was an interesting experience. Why did
they make shoes with heels like these? Better still, why had she
bought them? Because men thought they looked good? Well, they
did, but that wasn’t the reason. There was no man in her life; she
couldn’t imagine there would be, not for a long time after that
incident two months ago on Aristo.
The prince. The prince of darkness, was how she’d taken to
thinking of him, and she felt the anger rise inside her again.
Damn it, why was she remembering him, anyway? Why waste
time on him or that night? It had all been a nightmare. She hated
herself for it, would probably always hate herself for it, thought
not half as much as she hated him and…
And, there was no point in this.
Aristo, the commission she’dwanted so much and lost because
of him, were behind her. She had to concentrate on the present.
On how to convince shops like L’Orangerie to buy her designs.
That, she thought grimly, that was why she’d worn these
shoes.Why she’d spent as much on a stupid blow-out as she could
have spent to buy gold wire for the new earrings she’d been
sketching.Why she’d all but begged for today’s meeting with the
buyer from L’Orangerie. And where had it gotten her?
Nowhere, Maria thought as she reached the sidewalk. Nowhere
SANDRA MARTON 19
20 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
except out here, limping home like a derelict in sleet that was
rapidly turning to snow.
The weather, coupled with the fact that it was Friday, had sent
people fleeing their offices earlier than usual. Still, the street was
crowded. This was Manhattan, after all. The good news was that
because this was Manhattan, nobody so much as looked at her.
Still, she felt ridiculous, hobbling like this.
Yes, Maria, but the better news is that your heel could have
come off when you were on Fifth Avenue, heading for that
meeting with the man from L’Orangerie.
What an impression she’d have made then.
Not that it would have mattered.
L’Orangerie’s head buyer had been polite enough to keep the
lunch appointment and honest enough to begin it by telling her
he wasn’t going to buy her designs.
“I like them, Ms. Santos,” he’d said, “I like them very much—
but your name will mean nothing to our clients. Perhaps after
you’ve had a bit more exposure…?”
More exposure? Maria gave an inelegant snort as she turned
the corner. How much more exposure did she need? After
winning the Caligari prize, she’d sold to Tiffany’s. To Harry
Winston. To Barney’s.
She’d said all that to her luncheon companion. And he had
said yes, he knew she had, but her status in those places was insignificant
compared to designers like Paloma Picasso and Elsa
Peretti, n’est-ce pas?
Not, she’d wanted to say. Not n’est-ce pas.
Maybe she didn’t have a lot of pieces in the display cases.
Maybe the stores didn’t buy whole page ads for her in The New
York Times and the high fashion magazines. Okay, maybe they
didn’t advertise her name at all.
But she’d sold to the big players. That mattered. And the
pieces she’d designed were certainly more significant than that
phony French accent laid over the unmistakable underpinnings
of his Brooklyn upbringing.
She almost told him so.
SANDRA MARTON 21
Fortunately, sanity had made her put a forkful of salad instead
of her foot in her mouth.
She couldn’t afford to insult a jewelry buyer of such influence.
The world to which she wanted entry was small.
Gossipy. Insulting one of its door-keepers came under the
heading of ShootingYourself in the Head Just to See if the Gun
Would Fire.
Besides, he was right.
She’d been incredibly lucky to sell a few pieces to those
stores. Who knew if she’d ever sell them others? Who knew how
she’d sell them others? Not landing the Aristan commission had
been an enormous setback.
When you could add a discreet line to your business card that
said ‘By commission to Their Majesties, King Aegeus and Queen
Tia of Aristo,’ you had the world by the tail.
She’d lost the chance to have that happen.
Correction. A man had taken that chance from her. A man who
had seduced her and then tossed her out of his bed as if she’d
been a twenty-dollar whore.
“Stop that,” she muttered to herself. Why think of him now?
Why waste time looking back? There was no point.
Maria made a left on Broome Street, hobbled to the next
corner, turned down that street and, finally, there it was. Her
building. Well, not hers. The building in which she lived. And
worked. That was the great thing about renting a loft. There was
plenty of space within its high walls, room for sleeping and
eating, but mostly room for working.
If she could keep working.
The fact of the matter was, she was in debt up to her ears.
The loft cost thousands a month to rent. The gold and silver,
the precious and semi-precious stones with which she worked,
cost thousands, too. She had only one employee, Joaquin, but she
had to meet his salary every week. And designing something that
would be a fit gift for the Queen of Aristo’s sixtieth birthday had
taken hours and hours of time.
So she’d borrowed the small fortune she’d needed to pay her
22 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
rent, her bills, to set aside other projects and devote endless
hours to a design for the competition.
Useless, all of it. Useless.
She had been one of the three finalists. They’d all been invited
to Aristo, where the winner would be announced at a ceremony.
And she’d lost any possibility of being that winner in one night.
One foolish night.
A handful of hours had ruined her hopes and dreams, had left
her humiliated beyond measure and the truth was, it was her fault,
all of it. Not the fault of the man who’d seduced her.
Alexandros, the Prince of Aristo, had only proved what she
already knew. The hell with soft lights and sweet talk. All a man
wanted from a woman was sex. That she, of all women, should
have forgotten that cold truth and given in to a moment’s
weakness, was unforgivable.
Once you’d warmed a man’s bed, he had no further use for
you. If something unexpected happened, like, in this case, it
turning out that he was an Aristan prince and you were a finalist
in the competition to design his mother’s birthday gift, he’d lay
the blame for the seduction on you, even when he was the one
who’d done the seducing.
Her father had put the blame on her mother.
The mighty prince had put the blame on her.
“Damn this useless shoe,” Maria said furiously. To hell with
the snow and the icy pavement. She bent down, ripped off both
the broken shoe and its mate, and strode the last few wet yards
to her front door.
It swung open just as she reached it. Joaquin stepped onto the
street, smiled when he saw her but his smile changed to bewilderment
as his startled gaze dropped to her nylon-clad feet.
“Maria? ¿Cuál es la materia? ¿Por qué está usted descalzo
en este tiempo?”
Maria forced a smile. “Nothing’s wrong. I broke my heel,
that’s all.” She stepped past him into the vestibule. “I thought
you’d be gone by now.”
The door swung shut behind her. She started up the stairs to
SANDRA MARTON 23
the loft, Joaquin at her heels. There was a freight elevator, but,
as usual, it wasn’t working.
“I am still here, as you can see. I waited in hopes you would
return to tell me good news.”
Maria nodded but said nothing. When they reached the third
floor, she stabbed her key into the lock, walked briskly across
the age-dulled hardwood floor, dropped her shoes and bag on a
table near one of the loft’s big windows and turned toward her
old friend and co-worker.
“That was good of you.”
Joaquin’s warm brown eyes searched her face. “It did not go
well?”
Maria sighed as she slipped her coat from her shoulders. She
could lie or at least make the meeting with the buyer sound more
hopeful, but there was no point. Joaquin knew her too well. He’d
been working for her for five years. More than that, they’d grown
up in neighboring apartments in a crumbling building in the
Bronx, which was not a place most people thought of when they
spoke of New York.
Joaquin and his family had come from Puerto Rico to the
mainland when he was five and she was six. He was the brother
she’d never had.
So, no. Trying to fool him was useless.
“Maria?” he said softly, and she sighed.
“We didn’t get the contract.”
His expression softened. “Ah. I am so sorry. What happened?
I thought this Frenchman had good taste.”
“He’s not even a Frenchman,” Maria said with a little laugh.
“As for taste, well, he says he likes my work. But—”
“But?”
“But, I should get in touch with him when Jewels by Maria
is better known.”
“When it is,” Joaquin said stoutly, “you won’t need him.”
Maria grinned. “It’s just a good thing you’re married or I’d
nab you for myself.”
Joaquin grinned, too. It was an old joke and they both knew
24 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
it had no meaning. So did Joaquin’s wife, who was Maria’s
best friend.
“I’ll be sure and tell Sela you said that.”
“Tell her, too, that I’m looking forward to dinner on Sunday.”
“I will.” Joaquin tucked his hands in his overcoat pockets. “I
left the new wax castings on the workbench.”
“Thank you.”
“FedEx delivered the opals you ordered. I put them in the safe.”
“Excellent.”
Joaquin hesitated. “There is also a letter—a registered letter—
from the bank.”
“Of course there is,” Maria said sharply. She sighed and put
her hand lightly on Joaquin’s arm in apology. “Sorry.” She
smiled. “No need to kill the messenger, right?”
“You might change your mind when I tell you that your
mother phoned.”
Joaquin said it lightly but they both knew a call from Luz
Santos was rarely pleasant. Maria’s mother’s life had not gone
well; she held her daughter responsible. Having Maria had
changed her life. It had ended her dreams. Her plans. Not that she
had regrets. Oh, no. No regrets. She had sacrificed everything for
Maria but that was what mothers were supposed to do.
If only Maria would make the sacrifice worthwhile. If only
she would stop playing with trinkets and get a real job…
“My mother,” Maria said, and sighed again. “Did she say
what she wanted?”
“Her back is acting up. She has indigestion. Her doctor is of
no use to her.” Joaquin cleared his throat. “Mrs. Ferrara’s
daughter was just promoted.”
Maria nodded. “Of course.”
“So was your cousin Angela.”
“Again,” Maria said, deadpan.
“Again,” Joaquin agreed.
Suddenly, it seemed too much. The day. The disappointment.
The overdue bank loan. The flu symptoms she couldn’t shake,
and now a call from Mama… A little moan escaped her lips.
SANDRA MARTON 25
Joaquin put his arms around her and she gave in and leaned her
head against his shoulder.
“Maria, I have a fine idea. Come with me. You know Sela will
be thrilled to see you. She is making Chile Colorado for supper.
When was the last time you had something so delicious, hmm?”
She smiled, stood straight and knotted the woolen scarf at his
neck.
“Joaquin,” she said gently, “go home.”
“If there was a way Sela and I could help you—”
“I know.”
“If only you had gotten that commission. I still cannot understand
the reason you didn’t win.”
She understood it, but she’d sooner have died than divulge it.
“You’ll see, Joaquin. Everything will work out.”
“De su boca al oído del Dios.”
From her mouth to God’s ear. It made her smile again. She
clasped his face in her hands and kissed him lightly on the mouth.
“Go home, mi amigo.”
“Sela will be angry I left you alone at a time like this.”
“Tell Sela I love her but I am your boss,” Maria said with mock
severity, “and I sent you home.”
Joaquin grinned. “Yes, boss,” he said, and pressed a kiss to
her forehead.
She watched as he made his way to the door. It swung shut
after him and she wrapped her arms around herself and shuddered.
It was very cold in the loft. The high ceiling seemed to
steal the landlord’s miserly allotment of heat from the radiators
and the windows, though wonderfully big, were as old as the
building. On a day like this, the wind was relentless and sent
chilly air straight into the cavernous room.
A draft was blowing right on her. And a film of frost was just
beginning to form on the glass. Maria rubbed at it with her fist…
What was that car doing here?
It was parked just across the street. A big car, long and black
and elegant. She knew little about automobiles but in this stillungentrified
stretch of Lower Manhattan a Rolls or a Mercedes
26 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
or a Bentley, whatever the vehicle was, stood out like the proverbial
sore thumb.
Her lips turned down.
It was probably a realtor, trying to get a feel for things. They’d
been showing up as regularly as rats in the alley, a sure sign that
the area was about to become too expensive for people like her.
One realtor had even turned up at her door a couple of weeks ago,
oozing charm. She’d only managed to get rid of him by assuring
him she didn’t own her loft—though she hadn’t been able to keep
from telling him that if she did, there wasn’t a way in the world
she’d sell it to him.
In a gesture of defiance and frustration, she glared at the car
and stuck out her tongue. Then she drew back into the darkness,
laughing nervously at herself. What a crazy thing to do but on a
day that had gone as badly as this, it was better than nothing.
Alex, sitting in the back of the Bentley limo, blinked in surprise.
Had the Santos woman just stuck her tongue out at him?
No. Why would she do that? She couldn’t even see him. It was
dark. The windows of the car were tinted. She had no way of
knowing if there was someone in the car or not.
A distortion, then, caused by the cold and the heavily
falling snow.
Not that it had been falling heavily enough to have kept him
from seeing that cozy lovers’ greeting between her and the man
who’d just left. And not that he gave a damn. Five minutes to
explain why he was here, that the commission was hers, and that
would be the end of it.
This was for his mother. He could ignore his anger. His
disgust. He could do this.
He just wished he hadn’t had to view such a charming little
scene. It was enough to make his belly knot. A snowy evening.
A lover, so eager for his woman that he met her downstairs.
Greeted her with tenderness. Went back upstairs with her. Talked
to her. Kissed her…
And walked away.
SANDRA MARTON 27
Alex frowned.
What sort of lover was this man? Why had he chosen the cold
night instead of a woman’s heat? As for tenderness… Did he not
know that tenderness was not what Maria Santos wanted? She
was hot. Wild. Eager in bed.
Even now, he could remember how she had been that night.
Her scent. Lilies of the valley, he had thought, as delicate and
fragrant as those that grew wild in the hills near his home on the
cliffs. Her skin, warm and soft under his questing hands. Her hair,
brushing like silk against his throat.
Her nipples, sweet on his tongue.
Her mouth hot, so hot against his.
Her little cries. Her moans. That one incredible moment as
he’d entered her when he’d thought—when he’d imagined—
that she had never before known a man’s possession.
And, damn it, what in hell was he doing? His body had grown
hard, just remembering. Alex let down the window and drew a
long breath of cold, snow-laden air into his lungs.
The thing to remember was not how she had been in his bed
but the reason she had been there. It had not been an accident;
that she’d stood in seeming uncertainty just in front of the
building in which he had his offices in Ellos, guidebook in hand,
had been, he knew, deliberate.
He had not suspected it then.
But he’d noticed her right away. What man wouldn’t?
Slender, very pretty, her dark mane of hair pulled away from
her face by a simple gold clasp and left to tumble down her
back, her figure limned by the fading light of the day, she’d been
a delightful sight.
He’d paused as he came out the door. She had a pair of small
reading glasses perched on the end of her nose; somehow, that
had added to her charm.
American, he’d thought, a tourist. And, without question, lost.
He’d been in no particular hurry to go anywhere. Okay, why
not? he’d said to himself, and smiled as he’d approached her.
“Excuse me,” he’d said pleasantly, “but do you need some help?”
28 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
She’d looked up from the slim guidebook, her eyes a little blurry
because of the glasses. Her hesitation had been artful, just enough
to make her seem not just cautious but almost old-fashioned.
“Well—well—thank you. Yes, actually, I do. If you could tell
me… I’m looking for the Argus. It’s a restaurant. Well, a café.
The guidebook says it’s supposed to be right here. The hotel desk
clerk said so, too. But—”
“But it isn’t,” Alex had said, smiling again. “And, I’m afraid,
it hasn’t been, not for at least a year.”
Her face had fallen. Disappointment had only made her lovelier.
“Oh. Oh, I see. Well—thank you again.”
“You’re most welcome.”
She’d taken off her glasses and gone on looking up at him,
her eyes—hazel, he’d noted, neither brown nor green nor gold
but a veritable swirl of colors—as wide and innocent as a fawn’s.
Innocent as a fox approaching a hen house, he thought now,
his mouth thinning to a tight line.
Maria Santos had known exactly what she was doing, right up
to howshe’d reacted when he’d suggested another restaurant nearby.
“Is it…?” She’d hesitated. “I mean, is this other restaurant—?”
“As good as the Argus?” Truth was, he had no idea. He’d never
been to the Argus. From what little he recalled, it had been a tiny
café, just a place to get a quick bite.
“As inexpensive.” Color had swept into her cheeks. “The
guidebook says—”
“You don’t have to worry about that,” he’d said, because
she wouldn’t.
The restaurant he’d recommended was incredibly expensive—
but he would take her to it. He would dine with her and
pay the bill. Just to talk, he’d told himself. Just to be a good ambassador
for his country, even though—to his surprise—this
beautiful stranger did not seem to recognize his face when the
simple truth, much to his chagrin, was that spotting him was as
much a tourist attraction as the beaches, the yachts and the casino.
The hell she hadn’t recognized him.
She’d known who he was. She’d set the entire thing up.
SANDRA MARTON 29
But he had not known it, then.
She’d protested prettily that she couldn’t possibly let him pay
for her meal but she’d let him think he’d overcome her protests.
And, after dinner, when they’d walked along the sea wall, when
he’d kissed her while they stood surrounded by the tall pines that
grew on a little promontory and their kisses had gone from soft
and exploratory to hot and deep, when his hands had gone under
her silk skirt and she’d moaned into his mouth, when he’d put his
arm tightly around herwaist, still kissing her, and led her through
the now-quiet streets to his flat, to his bed, when she’d clung to
him and whispered she’d never done anything like this before…
When she’d come apart in his arms, her cries so sweet, so
wild, so real…
Alex cursed.
“Sir?” his driver said, but Alex ignored him, swung open the
door of the Bentley himself and stepped into the night.
Lies, all of it, lies that had come undone in the early morning
when he’d reached for her again and found her side of the bed
empty. He’d assumed she was in the bathroom.
She wasn’t.
He’d heard her voice, soft as the breeze from the sea. Was she
on the phone? Without knowing why he did it, he’d carefully
lifted the one on his night table and brought it to his ear.
Yes, he’d heard her say with a breathy little laugh, yes,
Joaquin, I think I really do have a good chance of being named
the winner. I know the competition is tough but I have every
reason to believe my chances are really excellent.
She’d looked up from the telephone when he walked into the
kitchen. Her face had gone crimson.
“You’re awake,” she’d begun to say, with an awkward smile.
He’d taken the phone from her hand. Pressed the ‘end’button.
Carried her back to bed without saying a word, taken her in
passion born of anger.
Then he’d told her to get her clothes on. To get the hell out.
And not to bother showing up at the palace, later.
“Your chances of being named to design my mother’s
30 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
birthday gift,” he’d said in clipped tones, “are less than those
of a snowball in hell.”
Alex strode across the street.
It had taken two months but that prediction was no longer just
a metaphor. Here was the snow. And, in just a couple of minutes,
Maria Santos would get a first-hand introduction to hell.
And he would get the satisfaction of putting her, and that
night, out of his head.
Forever.
CHAPTER THREE
MARIA sighed, peeled off her dressed-for-success suit jacket,
tossed it over the back of a chair and automatically reached for
the phone to return her mother’s call.
Her hand stilled.
What was she doing? A ten-minute litany of aches and pains,
followed by a lecture about how she needed to get a real job, were
the last things she wanted right now.
Get out of her clothes. Run a hot bath. Eat something. Then
she’d make the call.
Maria looked at her shoes, made a face and heaved them into
the big trash can beside her work table. Gorgeous but impractical.
She should have known better than to have bought them.
Gorgeous but impractical was not for her. It never had been.
And she hadn’t bought the shoes for today, she’d bought them
for the weekend she’d gone to Aristo. She’d wanted to look sophisticated,
but the shoes hadn’t done her much good then, either.
Even if she’d looked sophisticated, she’d behaved like a—likea—
No. She wasn’t going there. Not tonight. Rejected by a phony
Frenchman today, rejected by an arrogantAristan two months ago.
That was more than enough.
She stepped out of her skirt and padded, barefoot, to the end
of the loft that served as a sleeping area. She tossed the skirt on
the futon, peeled off her bra and pantyhose, yanked the clasp
from her hair, bent forward and ran her hands briskly through
32 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
the now-wildly curling strands. Then she tossed her head back,
grabbed a pair of old, scruffy sweats, and put them on.
Time for supper, though the thought of eating made her feel
vaguely queasy.
Nothing new in that. On top of everything else, she’d felt
vaguely ill for the past week or so. No big surprise, considering
that half the city was down with the flu. She probably had it, too,
but she couldn’t afford to give in to it right now, not with half a
dozen pieces to complete by the end of the month.
Her buyers expected her to be prompt. And she needed the
money they’d owe her on delivery.
So, no, she wouldn’t even admit to the possibility that she
might be sick. Absolutely not. She was under stress, she was
working hard. The fatigue, the heaviness in her limbs, the faint
sense of nausea that came and went…
Stress, was what it was.
Something to eat, something bland, would make her feel
better. Nerves had made her bypass breakfast; lunch had been a
joke. Definitely, she had to put something in her stomach.
Soup? Scrambled eggs? Grilled cheese? Better still, she could
order in from Lo Ming’s, down on the corner. Egg drop soup.
Steamed dumplings. Forget the calories. Forget the cost. An
order of Chinese comfort food, then she’d turn on the TV, curl
up on the sofa, get lost in something mindless while—
The doorbell rang.
Now what? It was late. Who would come here at this hour?
Of course. Joaquin. He knew what a setback today had been.
He’d probably gone half a block, phoned Sela on his cell phone
and she’d ordered him to go back and insist Maria come for supper.
The bell rang again. Maria pinned a smile to her lips, went to
the heavy door, undid the lock and pulled it open.
“Joaquin,” she said, “honestly, you have to learn to take ‘no’
for an ans…”
Alexandros Karedes, snow dusting the shoulders of his leather
jacket and glittering like jewels in his dark hair, stood at the door.
Maria felt the blood drain from her head.
SANDRA MARTON 33
“Good evening, Ms. Santos.”
His voice was as she remembered it. Deep. Husky. Perfect
English, but with the faintest hint of a Greek accent. And cold, as
cold as it had been that awful morning shewould never forget, when
he’d accused her of horrible things, called her terrible names…
“Aren’t you going to ask me in?”
She fought for composure. Last time they’d faced each other,
they’d been on his turf. Now they were on hers. She was in
command here, and that meant everything.
“There’s a sign on the door downstairs,” she said, her tone
every bit as frigid as his. “It says, ‘No soliciting or vagrants.’”
His lips drew back in a wolfish grin. “Very amusing.”
“What do you want, Prince Alexandros?”
Atight smile eased across his mouth and it killed her that even
now, knowing he was a vicious, arrogant man, she couldn’t help
but notice what a handsome mouth it was. Chiseled. Generous.
Beautiful, like the rest of him, which made him living proof that
beauty could, indeed, be only skin deep.
“Such formality, Maria. You were hardly so proper the last
time we were together.”
She knew his choice of words was deliberate. She felt her face
heat; she couldn’t help that but she damned well didn’t have to
let him lure her into a verbal sparring match.
“I’ll ask you once more,Your Highness. What do you want?”
“Ask me in and I’ll tell you.”
“I have no intention of asking you in. Tell me why you’re here
or don’t. It’s your choice, just as it will be my choice to shut the
door in your face.”
He laughed. It infuriated her but she could hardly blame him.
He was tall—six two, six three—and though he stood with one
shoulder leaning against the door frame, hands tucked casually
into the pockets of the jacket, his pose was deceptive. He was
strong, with the leanly muscled body of a well-trained athlete.
She remembered his body with painful clarity. The feel of him
under her hands. The power of him moving over her. The taste
of him on her tongue.
34 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
Suddenly, he straightened, his laughter gone. “I have not come
this distance to stand in your doorway,” he said coldly, “and I am
not going to leave until I am ready to do so. I suggest you stand
aside and stop behaving like a petulant child.”
A petulant child? Was that what he thought? This man who
had spent hours making love to her and had then accused her of—
of trading her body for profit?
Except, it had not been love, it had been sex. And the sooner
she got rid of him, the better.
She let go of the door knob and stepped aside. “You have
five minutes.”
He strolled past her, bringing cold air and the scent of the night
with him. She swung toward him, arms folded. He reached past
her, pushed the door closed, then folded his arms, too. She
wanted to open the door again but she’d be damned if she was
going to get into a who’s-in-charge-here argument with him.
She was in charge, and he would surely see a tussle over the
ground rules as a sign of weakness.
Instead, she looked past him at the big clock above her
work table.
“Ten seconds gone,” she said briskly. “You’re wasting time,
Your Highness.”
“What I have to say will take longer than five minutes.”
“Then you’ll just have to learn to economize. More than five
minutes, I’ll call the police.”
Instantly, his hand was wrapped around her wrist. He tugged
her toward him, his dark chocolate eyes almost black with anger.
“You do that.And I’ll tell every tabloid shark I can contact about
howMaria Santos tried to buy a five-hundred-thousand-dollar commission
by seducing a prince.” He smiled thinly. “They’ll lap it up.”
She blanched, but she kept her chin up and her eyes on his.
“Don’t try to scare me with lies! You can’t afford that kind
of gossip.”
“I’ve learned to endure that kind of gossip, Ms. Santos. It’s
part of my life. Besides, I’m the righteous prince who discovered
what you wanted and tossed you out on your backside.” Another
SANDRA MARTON 35
of those cold smiles twisted his lips. “They’ll eat you alive. How
do you think that will go over with the handful of reputable
clients you’ve somehow managed to snare?”
Maria yanked her hand free. “!Usted es un cochon!” she
hissed. “!Un cochon malnacido!”
“I think not. If I truly were an ill-bred pig, I would have told
you exactly what I thought of you eight weeks ago instead of just
throwing you out of my apartment.”
Color rushed to her cheeks. She hadn’t figured he understood
Spanish but, then, she’d been wrong in every judgment she’d
made about this man from the start.
“You did tell me,” she snapped, “and now it’s my pleasure to
return the favor.You’re down to four minutes before I call the cops.
Dealing with the media will beworth it, if I can just get rid of you.”
“What’s the problem, Maria? Expecting your lover to return?”
“What?”
“Your lover. What did you call him that morning? Joaquin?”
Joaquin. The idea was so ludicrous she almost laughed, but
laughter would take more energy than she could spare. Besides,
she didn’t have to explain anything.
“Joaquin is none of your business.”
“You’re right, of course.” Alex strolled across the room to the
front windowand peered out at his limo,waiting at the curb across
the street. “But I had a front-row seat for your little welcome
home this evening.You can’t blame me for being curious.”
Maria rushed to the window. A front-row seat? Impossible.
The Prince of Arrogance would surely not have stood in the cold
and the snow, watching her window…
The big car. It was his. Furious, she swung toward her unwelcome
guest.
“You were sitting out there, spying on me?”
“You might want to consider curtains,” he said with lazy
self-assurance.
“You—you…” She pointed a finger at the door. “Get out
of my home!”
Alex didn’t move. Instead, he tucked his hands in the slash
36 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
pockets of his jacket and gave her a long look, starting at her feet
and working slowly up to her face. She certainly wasn’t dressed
like a woman waiting for her lover to come back. Not in a pair
of baggy sweats that had seen better days. There was a hole in
one knee, what looked like a burn in the shirt just below her collarbone.
Her feet were bare, her hair a wild mass of curls.
His belly knotted.
Her hair had been like that the last time he’d seen her, a tumble
of long, glorious curls falling around her heart-shaped face. She’d
been wearing his robe; she’d been lost in it and somehowthat had
made her look even sexier, maybe because he’d known, intimately,
what was beneath that robe. The delicate, golden-hued
skin. The small, uptilted breasts. The slim curve of her waist, the
surprisingly feminine richness of her hips.
Her face had been sexy, too. Glowing eyes. Dewy skin. No
make-up, not even lipstick, though her mouth had been rosy and
softly swollen from his kisses.
She had looked—what did the French call it? Déshabillé. As
if she had just come from bed.
Which she had. His bed. His bed and his possession, and that
memory was enough to do more than make his belly knot. It sent
a bolt of pure lust straight to his loins.
He still wanted her.
It had taken the sight of her in a scruffy sweatshirt and
baggy sweatpants before he’d permitted himself to admit it.
What man wanted to acknowledge he still desired a woman
who’d tried to use him?
One who was a fool, he told himself. And then he thought,
no. Hell, no. That wasn’t it at all. Maria Santos owed him and
that was her fault, not his. She had lured him into bed. Seduced
him, though he’d thought he was the one doing the seducing.
She’d plotted everything, from that supposedly accidental
meeting on the street to the moment he’d first kissed her. The
only thing surprising about that night was that she’d been able
to keep from smirking triumphantly when he’d asked her to
come home with him.
SANDRA MARTON 37
She’d made a fool of him, and she still owed him for that.
Owed him big time, as the Americans said. And until that
debt was paid, the memory of his humiliation would continue
to haunt him.
He had no doubt what it would take to expunge that memory.
Her, in his bed again. Moving beneath him. Coming on a
long, explosive cry as he watched her with clinical detachment.
There’d be no phony little cries. No subterfuge. He would make
her want him, make her react to him.
And then he’d send her packing for the second, and last, time.
“Your five minutes are up, Prince Alexandros.”
Alex looked at her. Her expression, her body language, were
defiant. She thought she was in charge.
That made him smile.
“You find this amusing?”
“Indeed.”
Her eyes narrowed. “I’m going to count to ten. It’s your last
chance. If you’re not out the door by then—”
“Safir et Fils is on the verge of collapse.”
She blinked. “Who?”
“Safir et Fils,” he repeated impatiently. “The French firm that
was awarded the commission.” She was staring at him blankly.
“Come on, Ms. Santos,” he said silkily. “Don’t try and tell me
the name of the company that won a commission you were
willing to prostitute yourself to get has slipped your—”
Her hand flew through the air but he was quicker than she was.
He caught her wrist, dragged her forward and hauled her to her toes.
“Do not,” he said with quiet menace, “ever raise your hand
to me again!”
“Let go of me!”
“Did you hear what I said?—”
“What a bastard you are!”
Her voice shook; tears glittered in her eyes and she was
breathing hard. So what? He was unimpressed.
“Playing the righteous innocent will get you nowhere, agapi
mou. You made a fool of me once but I promise you, it will never
38 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
happen again. And do not call me names. I am a prince. I urge
you to remember that.”
He almost winced. He sounded like an ass but how could he
think while hot rage pumped through his blood? She was an excellent
actress; he knew that. And this was another stellar performance.
The damp eyes. The trembling voice. The patches of
crimson on her face.
Her face. Beautiful, even now.
“Did you think you could get away with what you did, Maria?
Letting me think you’d been carried away by passion when what
carried you away was the greedy hope that sleeping with me
would give you an advantage in the design competition?”
He paused. Maria stared at him.
Was he waiting for her to answer? What was the point? If she
said he was wrong, he wouldn’t believe her. He hadn’t, that
awful morning.
“Liar,” he’d said, in a voice cold as death, and then he’d hurled
words at her in Greek that she hadn’t understood, though their
meaning had been painfully clear.
Trying to make him listen now would not only be pointless,
it would be demeaning.
The truth was, she hadn’t even known who he was that night.
Aprince? The son of Queen Tia and KingAegeus?As far as she’d
known, he was just a man.A gorgeous, incredibly sexy, fascinating
stranger whose smile, whose touch had made her breathless.
When he’d kissed her and the kisses hadn’t been enough,
when he’d touched her and those touches weren’t enough, she’d
forgotten everything—that they were in a public place, that she
was a moral woman, that she had never been with a man before.
And when he’d whispered, Come with me, she had gone with
him. How could she have done anything else?
Her world had been reduced to him. To his mouth. His hands.
His hard, flagrantly aroused masculinity. She still couldn’t
believe she’d let such a thing happen. You didn’t sleep with a
stranger. She didn’t, anyway.
“What’s the matter, sweetheart? Is that busy little brain of
SANDRA MARTON 39
yours trying to come up with an answer that will satisfy me?”
His voice roughened. “Don’t waste your time. There’s only one
thing that will satisfy me, and you know what that is.”
What he meant was in his eyes.
She saw it and stumbled back. He could see the beat of her
pulse in the hollow of her throat. Good, he thought coldly. This
time, at least, he had the advantage. Command had slipped from
her hands to his and she hadn’t even heard the worst of what he’d
come to tell her.
“Get out.”
She spoke in a papery whisper that he ignored. Instead, he
turned his back and walked to her work table. Sketches were
tacked to an enormous corkboard on the wall above it.
Something that looked as if it had been molded from wax stood
on a shelf.
“Didn’t you hear me? I said—”
“Didn’t you hear me?” He swung toward her, arms folded, feet
crossed at the ankles. “Safir et Fils are going under.”
“Do you expect me to weep for them?”
“They will not be able tomake the gift formymother’s birthday.”
Her smile was pure saccharine. “Stop at Wal-Mart before
you fly home.”
“I know you find this amusing, Maria, but it’s deadly serious.
March the seventh will be an important day. My father has
declared it a national holiday.”
Again, that glittery smile. She had her composure back—but
not for long.
“There will be a ball attended by dignitaries from around
the world.”
“Yes, well if you can’t find anything you like atWal-Mart—”
“My parents have chosen you to execute the commission.”
Her jaw dropped. She was speechless. Twice in one evening.
He had the feeling it was some kind of record.
“Me?”
“You.” His mouth twisted. “You see, despite what I told you
that night, I never mentioned your little game to either the king
40 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
or the queen. I didn’t have to. My father had chosen the French
jewelers. He preferred their submission.”
Maria swallowed hard. She wanted to shriek with delight but
she’d be damned if she gave him that.
“How—how nice. To be second-best.”
“Please. Sarcasm doesn’t become you.” Why mention that the
queen had preferred her design all along? “We both know that
this is the chance of a lifetime for a woman like you.”
Her cheeks flushed again. “What, exactly, is that supposed to
mean?”
“Why, only that your name, your career will be made when
word gets out, Maria. What else could it possibly mean?”
She was sure that hadn’t been his meaning but why argue
about it? The fact was, he had it right. Orders would double.
They’d triple! Tiffany would give her a window display; so would
Barney’s. Vogue, Vanity Fair, Allure, Elle, Marie Claire…every
fashion magazine in the world would camp on her doorstep and
the noxious pseudo-Frenchman would be on his knees, begging
her to design for L’Orangerie.
If only the court hadn’t sent the prince to give her the news.
“They sent me,” Alex said, as if he’d read her mind, “because
they wanted to be sure you understood the full importance of this
commission.”
“You mean,” Maria countered sweetly, “because the king
thought your illustrious royal presence would impress me.” He
grinned. Her gaze on him narrowed. “Too bad your father doesn’t
know you as well as I do.”
All at once, Alex was weary of the game. Why in hell had he
ever thought he needed to settle scores? He was not a man who
enjoyed revenge; God knew there was plenty of opportunity for
it in business but he had always seen vengeance-seeking as a low
sport.And payback against awoman, even one who really needed
to be taught a lesson, suddenly held no appeal.
“What’s your answer?” he said brusquely. He pushed back his
sleeve, shot an impatient glance at his watch. “My pilot is
standing by. Weather permitting, I want to fly home tonight.”
SANDRA MARTON 41
Maria chewed on her lip. God, the man was arrogant. If
only she could tell him what he could do with his offer, but
he was right. This would jump-start her career. Nothing she
could ever do would match its importance. She had to say
‘yes’, but surely there was a way to do it so she could regain
her authority.
“Very well,” she said. “I’ll accept the commission.”
He nodded and reached into the inside breast pocket of his
leather jacket.
“Good. I have some papers here…”
“There are certain conditions to be met,” she said as she took
the documents from him.
His dark eyebrows rose. “There are, indeed. Dates of
approval. A date of completion. An agreement as to what you
may and may not discuss with the media—”
“One,” Maria said, “I work alone. If I need an assistant, that
person will be of my choosing.”
“I don’t think you understand. This agreement concerns the
demands of the—”
“Two, I’ll need some new equipment.” She smiled thinly.
“Aristo’s cost. Not mine.”
Alex’s mouth flattened. “You’re fortunate to be getting this
commission, Ms. Santos. Perhaps you’ve forgotten that.”
“Three. I do not work well with anyone watching over my
shoulder. In otherwords, I’ll be happy to showmywork, as it progresses,
to the king and queen at their request—but no one else.”
The muscle in Alex’s jaw jumped to attention. “Is that last
directed at me?”
“Four,” Maria said, raising her hand and ticking the point off
on her finger, but he had stopped listening.
Who did she think she was, this snippet of a female? He was
not of the old school; nobody had to bow to him or bend a knee
in a deep curtsy, well, except, of course, on formal occasions of
the court, but he was entitled to the respect he had been born to
as a prince, the respect he had won as a man—
“If all those conditions are agreeable, I’ll sign your document.”
42 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
Alex didn’t answer. He stood watching her from dark, unreadable
eyes and felt the tension inside him growing.
He had left Aristo knowing he had to deal with Maria Santos
and keep his composure. Nothing more.
Then another thought had come to him. He would bed her
again. Right here. Tonight. It was he who would do the seducing
this time, if not with his body then with the commission she’d so
willingly sold her soul to get. He’d strip her naked, touch her
everywhere, kneel between her thighs and take her again and
again and again, until she was out of his system.
A moment ago, he’d come full circle. Told himself that plan
was crazy. It was not him. Taking a woman out of revenge was
beneath him. It was, he’d told himself, enough that she’d know
she was getting the commission only because the true winner of
the competition was out of the picture.
There’d been that instant of pleasure.
Then she’d taken that instant and crushed it.
Who did she think she was, to make demands of him? Of the
royal court? Did she think she had the right to treat him as if he
were an errand boy?
“Are you listening to me, Your Highness?”
Alex looked at her. Her eyes glittered with contempt; her very
posture confirmed it. Oh yes. She saw him as an errand boy. Not
her mark this time. The court’s errand boy.
“I take it you heard my last stipulation,” she said. “I will not
deal with you after tonight. Is that clear?”
He could feel his body humming with anger. He wanted to
haul her into his arms and shake her. Humiliate her. Conquer her.
Strip her of that ridiculous pair of sweats, bare her to his eyes,
his hands, his mouth…
He took a step forward. Something of what he felt must have
shown in his face because she paled and took a step back. That’s
right, he thought coldly. Be afraid of me, Maria. Be afraid of
what I’m going to do…
The phone rang. She grabbed it as if it were a lifeline.
“Hello?” She listened, then cleared her throat. “Yes, sí, I
SANDRA MARTON 43
know. Yes, I know that, too. I’m sorry you had to wait for my
call.” Her eyes swept to Alex; she turned her back as if that
would give her the privacy she needed. “Could we discuss this
another time?” she said in a low voice.
Alex had moved with her; his eyes, fixed on her, still held that
dangerous glitter. Didn’t he understand she needed privacy? Who
did he think she was talking to? Joaquin, probably. That almost
made her laugh. The voice whining in her ear was her mother’s.
And hearing from Luz was the last thing she needed right now.
She turned again, desperately wishing this were a cordless
phone so she could walk further away. Her mother was telling
her about her cousin Angela—snide, holier-than-thou Angela—
and her latest promotion at the insurance company. Maria had
only to ask, Luz was saying, as she did every few weeks, and
Angela would get her a job interview.
“Let me tell you my wonderful news,” she said quickly,
breaking into her mother’s endless praise for Angela. “That commission?
The one to design the birthday jewels for Queen Tia of
Aristo? Well, I’ve landed it.”
She waited, although she really didn’t know what she was
waiting for. She knew better than to think her mother would
shriek with joy and say, I’m so proud of you, mia bella, or even,
That’s wonderful news. But she didn’t really expect Luz to say,
“You?” as if such a thing were impossible.
“You lost the competition.You were not good enough to win it.”
Maria winced. “Yes. Well—well, things changed. There was
a problem with the winner and so—”
“Ah.” Her mother’s sigh spoke volumes. “Well, no matter
how you came by it, it is an opportunity. Be sure you do nothing
to ruin it.”
Maria felt like weeping, which was ridiculous. Why should
tonight be different than the past twenty-eight years?
What made it evenworsewas that Alex had not taken his eyes
from her. It was infuriating. His Royal Highness was a Royal
Boor when it came to manners. Didn’t he know enough to walk
away when someone was having a private conversation?
44 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
“One of the things your cousin Angela has always done is to
make the most of her chances.”
“Yes. I know.” Maria cleared her throat. “It’s late. I’ll talk to
you tomorrow.”
Another deep sigh came over the phone. “God willing I will
be here tomorrow. And please, Maria, do not waste time telling
me the doctors saymyhealth is excellent.What do doctors know?”
There was no point in answering. That road, well-traveled
over the decades, led nowhere.
“Good night,” Maria said, “I love—”
Too late. Luz had already disconnected. Maria put down the
phone and swallowed hard. The Prince of Arrogance hadn’t
moved; he was still standing right next to her. She drew a long
breath, let it out as slowly as she could, then turned to face him.
“Wasn’t he interested in your charming declaration of affection?”
“Excuse me?”
“Your lover. Joaquin. I had the impression he ended the call
rather abruptly. Didn’t your news please him?”
“That wasn’t—” She bit her lip. Would having a lover,
however imaginary, offer her some protection? She needed protection;
every instinct told her that. “That wasn’t polite,” she said.
“Listening to my conversation.”
He smiled thinly. “And you, Ms. Santos, are the expert on etiquette,
are you not?” The smile vanished; he shoved a gold pen
at her. “Sign the contract.”
Why did that sound so ominous? “I insist you meet my conditions
before I—”
Suddenly, his hands were on her, cupping her shoulders,
lifting her to her toes.
“You’re lucky to be getting this commission,” he said coldly.
“We both know that. You’re desperate for money—please, don’t
waste my time denying it. And you need the prestige that comes
with creating a necklace for a queen.” His tone hardened. “Sign
the contract, Maria.”
SANDRA MARTON 45
Her lip trembled. She looked away from him and, for a heartbeat,
he hated himself.
Was he really reduced to this? Bullying a woman on the skids?
A woman whose lover had obviously not said a word to congratulate
her on winning this commission?
And why should he give a damn? Maria Santos was nothing
to him.
“Sign the papers,” he growled.
She picked up the pen, smoothed out the documents, laid them
on the table and scribbled her name where he indicated. He felt a
surge of heat sweep through him. But he said nothing, simply took
the papers, folded them and tucked them back in his pocket.
“As for conditions…there are others besides the ones I mentioned.
There are my conditions,” he said in a softly ominous
tone. “And you will meet them.”
His gaze dropped to her lips. She felt her pulse begin to race.
Whatever he was about to say was going to turn her world upside
down; she could sense it.
“One,” he said, still in that soft voice, “you shall have the
studio of your dreams—but on Aristo, not here.”
“Are you insane? I have no intention of—”
“I assume your passport is in order.”
“Of course, but—”
“You will leave with me, tonight.”
“You cannot do this to—”
He bent to her and kissed her. Kissed her as if she belonged
to him, his tongue in her mouth, his hands cupping her bottom,
lifting her to him, into him, into the heavy thrust of his erection.
“And,” he said thickly, when he finally raised his head, “you
will warm my bed until you finish the job.”
“No!” She shook her head as if to emphasize her refusal.
“No,” she said again, her voice high and wild, “I’ll never—”
“You will, or I’ll do what I should have done when you left
my bed the first time. I’ll tell the queen about our little adventure.
I’ll tell her you’re not worthy of designing her gift or of
working in proximity to her. And then you can stay in this loft
46 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
and forever live with the knowledge that you failed at the one
thing that could have changed your life.”
Maria wanted to weep but she knew damned well her tears
would have made him not just the victor but the conqueror.
Instead, she forced herself to meet his gaze without flinching.
“Is this how you get your women, Your Highness? Through
blackmail?”
His eyes flashed a warning. She tried to pull away but his
mouth swooped down to hers; his hands swept into her hair,
holding her captive to his merciless kiss until, at last, a sweet
moan whispered from her throat.
Despite her fury and her hatred, it was happening again.
The hot spiral of desire she’d felt that night all those weeks ago.
The sudden swift race of her heart. All those amazing, incredible
feelings she’d never known before were sweeping her away.
She was dizzy in his arms, dizzy from the taste of him, the
scent, the feel of his hand, now in her hair, his fingers cupping
her scalp. He gathered her even closer. The hard press of his
arousal dug into her belly.
Oh God. She wanted him, wanted him, wanted him…
Mariawound her arms aroundAlex’s neck and kissed him back.
CHAPTER FOUR
SHE was on fire.
It had been like this that night on Aristo.
Alex had kissed her, and it had been like touching a match to
tinder.
Until then, she’d always thought descriptions like that were
clichés, the stuff of novels and movies, but Alex had taken her
in his arms and taught her that a man’s touch could change everything
you knew, everything you believed, forever.
One kiss. Onewarm mingling of breath. One caress of lips and
tongues and you were transformed, became someone else.
Someone you didn’t know, didn’t understand.
Didn’t respect.
Her eyes flew open. She slammed her hands against Alex’s
broad chest. He made a sound that was almost a growl and
gathered her closer. Her struggles increased.
“Alex! Damn you, let me go.”
For a moment, herwords didn’t penetrate.Hewas lost in the taste
of Maria, the feel of her soft body against his. But her hands became
small fists, hammering at his shoulders. The message was clear.A
moment’s tease, just enough to drive him half out of his mind…
It wasn’t going to work.
He opened his eyes and let go of her.
“Pack your things.”
His voice was low and rough, his muscles taut with anger and
48 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
frustration. She had a way of getting to him and he didn’t like it.
It was not something he was accustomed to.
“That’s it?” Her voice shook with indignation. “You walk in
here, announce that I’m going to—to be your sex slave—”
“My mistress,” he said, mentally cursing himself. How had
she reduced him to this?
“You think that makes it better? You cannot walk in here, manhandle
me and expect—expect—”
“Is that what you call it when you turn soft and hot in a man’s
arms and all but beg him to take you?”
Her face colored. “Get out!”
“Try singing a different tune, agapimeni. The one about being
a shocked virgin is getting tiresome.”
“Is there something about ‘get out’ you don’t understand?”
“And what of the contract you just signed, Maria? Shall I take
that to court and have a judge deal with it?”
“Don’t threaten me!”
“It’s not a threat, it’s a warning. You’ve committed to creating
the queen’s birthday gift, to be completed by twenty-eight
February and subject to my approval.”
“Your approval?”
“Indeed,” he said coldly. “Perhaps you should have read the
contract more thoroughly.”
Maria wanted to laugh. Or cry. Either seemed appropriate.A
minute ago, Alex had been kissing her passionately. Now, he was
talking to her as if he were a prosecutor and she a balky witness.
Did he think he could use sex to control her? Or maybe he
thought he could bully her. Big mistake! She’d grown up on the
streets of the Bronx. What was royal arrogance compared to
Bronx attitude?
“Contracts,” she said, just as coldly, “are made to be broken.”
Alex raised an eyebrow. “Did you lift that line from some
trendy legal show?”
She flushed. Close enough. She’d taken it from an article
about how a hotshot movie star had gotten away with walking
out on a film.
SANDRA MARTON 49
“And you’re right,” he said, taking the contract from his
pocket, flipping to a page and holding it out. “Some are. This one
is not. Take a look at paragraph three.”
Why did doing as he’d suggested smack of defeat? Was it his
smug tone, or was it the instinctive knowledge that what she’d
find in that paragraph would not be good? She snatched the
contract from his hand, read the pertinent sentences…and felt a
shock of disbelief flash through every nerve in her body.
Failure of the party of the first part to complete the agreedupon
commission and/or to fulfill the additional duties required
of her in their entirety…
Her head snapped up. “What?”
“Ah,” he said, his voice a low purr, “I can see that you really
didn’t read this before you signed it.A bad decision, I’m afraid.”
“That’s insane! You cannot contract for—for a mistress…”
“Keep reading,” he said softly.
Did she have a choice? Her gaze dropped to the contract.
Such failure shall result in forfeiture of all goods and services
already provided and repayment for same.
“What goods and services?” She looked up and flashed a triumphant
smile. “You haven’t provided any.”
“Have you forgotten you’re flying to Aristo with me? Did you
think I wouldn’t provide you with a workshop and tools?” He
jerked his chin toward the contract. “There’s more.”
Finally, in the event of forfeiture, an additional penalty to be
paid by Maria Santos in the amount of…
The typed-in number had so many zeroes it made her laugh.
Alex’s eyes narrowed.
“I assure you, this is not meant for your amusement.”
No. Of course not, but what else could she do when the
penalty for walking away was easily ten times the value of everything
she owned?
“You must know I can’t afford anything even close to that!”
He shrugged. “I know only what is in the agreement you
just signed.”
He sounded as removed as if they were discussing when the
50 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
snow might stop. It not only killed her hysterical laughter, it
killed any hope she’d had that this was a joke.
“But—but I’d lose everything. This loft. My clients. The
people I deal with would suffer, the ones who subcontract to me.
And Joaquin, who’s been with me from the start—”
“Your lover’s welfare is not my concern.”
“Joaquin is not my lover.” Maria flung the contract at his feet.
“He works for me.”
He bent and picked it up, smoothing the pages, his expression
blank.
“It doesn’t matter one way or the other. My only concern is
this contract. Are you going to abide by it or not?
She stared at him, hating him, hating herself even more. How
could she have slept with him that night? Better still, how could
she have returned his kisses just now? Was she truly, pathetically
her mother’s daughter?
She wanted to curse him. To pummel those broad shoulders
with her fists, but what would that change? Nothing, she thought
bitterly, nothing at all.
“This is usury!”
He grinned. Such a ruggedly beautiful face, she thought
wildly, made even sexier by that quick devil’s smile.
“An impressive legal term,” he said. “But incorrect. The
penalty to which you’ve agreed has nothing to do with a loan.”
“Damn it,” she exploded, “do not play word games with me!
I know what usury means. And I know what this contract is.
Unconscionable. Immoral. Cruel and mean-spirited and—”
“And enforceable.”
“You cannot coerce a woman into—what was your phrase?
Into warming your bed!”
Suddenly, he was standing much too close. She stumbled back
but his big hands were already framing her face and lifting it to him.
“There’s not a word that even hints of coercion in that
contract,” he said softly. “You signed it of your own free will.”
“How can you do this?” she said shakily. “Don’t you have
any scruples?”
SANDRA MARTON 51
He laughed softly. “An interesting question, coming from
you.” His smile faded; his gaze dropped to her lips. “One month,
agapi mou. That’s all it will be. One month of being in my bed.
Of spending the nights with me deep inside you.” His lips
twitched, as if he’d made a joke, but his eyes were so dark they
seemed bottomless. “I can endure it, if you can.”
His words made her blush. How could he joke about the
devil’s bargain he was forcing on her?
“I hate you,” Maria snapped.
Alex grinned. “Hate me all you like, sweetheart. It’s not your
heart I’m after.”
No, she thought, no, it wasn’t. And that was fine because her
heart would never be part of this arrangement.
“Understand something, Your Highness,” she said, searching
for and finding a way to salvage one tiny bit of pride. “Being in
your bed is one thing. Participating in what happens there is not
something you can ever expect.”
His teeth flashed in a quick smile. “A challenge?”
“A statement of fact.”
“A challenge,” he said flatly. “One I am happy to accept.”
He bent his head, brushed his lips over hers. His mouth moved
against hers again and again in the lightest of kisses. She wanted
to lean into him. Wanted to close her eyes, part her lips, clasp his
head and bring it down closer to hers…
I feel nothing, she told herself.
And wished to God it were true.
What in the name of Chronos was she doing? Was she packing
everything she owned? Jeans. T-shirts. Sweaters. Sneakers and
sandals and, hell, another pair of jeans.
Alex looked at his watch, scowled and shook his wrist. Was
the damned thing working? Impossible that only five minutes had
passed since she’d first turned on her heel, marched away from
him and dragged a suitcase from a corner of the loft.
The loft. Her loft. His lip all but curled. He’d been in
Manhattan lofts before. Soaring ceilings. Enormous windows.
52 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
Brick walls and polished wood floors. Furniture from
Scandinavia that made the most of all that open space.
Maria’s loft lacked only whatever machines had once been installed
here. Raw space, NewYork realtors called it, and made it
sound as if that was a good thing—which, he supposed, it was if
you intended to transform it into something habitable.
This was not habitable.
The floor was wood but the finish had long since worn away.
The walls were brick. Not warm brick, just brick. Old, dark, depressing.
The ceiling soared, all right. It soared straight up to an
intimidating tangle of pipes and electrical lines.
As for furniture…there were a couple of work tables. Some
cabinets and benches. Boxes. More boxes. And, in this end of the
room, farthest from the entry door, a screen that he assumed concealed
the bathroom, or what passed for a bathroom, and in front
of that, a bed.
Maria’s bed.
Neatly made. Simple. Almost convent-like in appearance…
A double bed.
Alex’s jaw tightened.
His own bed—his beds, considering the number of homes he
owned—his beds were always king-sized. A bachelor’s necessity,
his brothers called them. Plenty of room for a man and a
woman and hours of hot sex.
But a double bed might have advantages.
There’d be little space in which to sprawl while the lovers in
Maria’s bed took some needed rest. They would have to sleep
on their sides, spoon fashion, she with her backside tucked into
his groin, her spill of wild, sexy curls tucked beneath his chin.
He would wake during the night, feel the heat of her against him
and his sex would engorge, fill with heat, throb as he shifted his
weight, as she backed up to him, as she awoke and drowsily whispered
his name while he sought her moist entrance, while he
pistoned within her until she cried out…
Skata!
He was watching Maria pack and turning himself on.
SANDRA MARTON 53
How could she have that much power over him? He didn’t like
it, not one bit. Men were the ones who held power and if that
marked him as old-fashioned, so be it.
He had surely made the right move. Taking her to his bed as
often as he wishedwould purge her from his system.And no matter
what she said, she would not be unwilling for long. She could talk
about not wanting him all she liked but when he touched her, all
that staunch denial fled.To hell with the fact that she despised him.
He felt the same about her. What he’d told her was true enough.
Sex had nothing to do with emotion.
As for her threat not to react in his bed… A lie. A magnificent
lie. He knew a thousand ways to make her react. His mouth
at her breasts. Between her thighs. On her clitoris…
“Damn it,” he growled, and strode toward the bed on which
her suitcase stood open. “That’s enough!”
She swung toward him. “What?”
“Perhaps you have forgotten what my country is like,” he said
through his teeth. “It is not the wilderness.We have shops.”
The understatement of the year, Maria thought. Ellos had all
the shops that made Fifth Avenue paradise and dozens more.
Unfortunately, it had the prices to go with them. She wouldn’t
have the money to step through those doors until she completed
this commission. One new outfit, she’d been in debt for life.
Not that that was a possibility. The outfit she’d worn today
had pretty much melted her credit card.
“Excuse me,” she said with enough sugar in the words to
cause diabetic coma, “but I’m not done.”
“You are done,” he said grimly. “You’ve packed enough for
ten women.”
What she’d done was pack enough for one woman who had
no idea what the weather was like halfway around the world this
time of year.Yes, she could ask him, but that would be a show of
weakness. Stupid, perhaps, but that was the way she felt.
So she’d taken jeans. T-shirts. Sandals. Hiking boots.
Sweaters. She’d considered something dressy, but what for? She
would not be going out in the evenings.
54 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
She would be going to the prince’s bed.
She stared at him as he closed the suitcase. She hated him as
a woman; as an artist, she couldn’t help but admire him.Well, no.
Not him. NotAlexandros Karedes.What she admiredwas his long,
leanly muscled body. His wide shoulders and broad chest. Narrow
hips and long legs. The black-as-midnight hair, the dark eyes, the
face that Praxiteles might have chiseled from the finest marble.
He was even more beautiful nude.
She remembered that. The corded muscles in his arms. The
ridged abs. The powerful thrust of his penis rising from a cluster
of dark curls…
Maria swung away and went to the workshop end of the loft.
Forget that. Block it from her mind. Besides, despite all that
about the contract, he couldn’t mean to enforce such a demand.
The more she thought about it, the more assured she grew that
the sleep-with-me nonsense was just a particularly nasty way of
reminding her that she had no standing in his world.
Fine, she thought, plucking a big leather tote from a shelf and
sweeping a handful of tools into it, absolutely fine. Let him play
his stupid games. One month, that was all, a month of his
bullying tactics and then—
Unless she was wrong.
What if hewas serious? What if he really expected her to sleep
with him? Well, not ‘sleep’. She remembered that one night in
his bed. They hadn’t slept at all. He’d taken her over and over,
driven her out of her mind each time, made her do things…
No. Her breath caught.
He hadn’t ‘made’ her do anything. She’d wanted to do them,
things she’d heard of and read about but never, ever imagined
she’d want to do.
And would never do again.
Blindly, she grabbed another handful of tools and dumped
them in the tote.
What she’d told him was true. If he insisted on holding her to
their devil’s bargain, she would not participate. She would lie in
his bed but shewould not move. She’d let his hands seek out every
SANDRA MARTON 55
shadowed valley. Let him put his mouth on hers. On her breasts.
Between her thighs. She’d let him do everything he wanted but
she would not react, she would not, would not…
She gasped as Alex grabbed the tote from her, snapped the
lock, then hoisted it and her suitcase from the floor.
“We’re leaving.”
“I need the rest of those tools—or maybe you thought I work
gold and precious stones with tweezers and a crowbar?”
“Did you not hear me when I said you will have the studio of
your dreams?”
“I heard you. I still want my own things. It’s how people are,
when they’ve worked at the same job for a while. They want the
stuff they’re familiar with, whether it’s a pen or a chisel. I know
that’s difficult for you to get your head around, considering that
you’ve never had to do a day’s work in your life, so you’ll just
have to take my word for it.”
Alex narrowed his eyes. Was that really how she saw him? As
a royal dilettante? He thought back to his father’s initial reaction
when he’d first approached him about bringing new economic
life to Aristo.
“What could you possibly bring to Aristo that I have not?”
Aegeus said, with his usual imperialistic charm.
A casino, for one.A new commercial port that specialized in
handling enormous cargo ships. A colony of upscale second or
third or fourth or even fifth homes for multi-billionaires looking
for seclusion on the island’s northeast coast overlooking the Bay
of Apollonia. He had even managed to divert some of the superrich
from building in the new resort town of Jaladhar on the
island of Calista, which, together with Aristo, had made up the
Kingdom of Adamas until they’d been declared separate nations
by his grandfather, King Christos, more than three decades ago.
So, no. Oh, no. He had never worked a day in his life. He travelled
between his offices in New York and Ellos, he flew to all
the major cities of the world, met and negotiated with hardheaded
businessmen and heads of state and it was all nothing but
a wealthy man’s hobby. Or so this woman thought.
56 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
He glared at Maria. At the smug little smile on her lips. Part
of him wanted to grab her and shake her.
Part wanted to pull her into his arms and kiss her until she
begged for him to do more.
Thank God he wasn’t fool enough to do either. Instead, he
jerked his chin in her direction.
“Coat,” he said briskly. “And shoes. Make it quick or I’ll sling
you over my shoulder and carry you downstairs just as you are.”
He would do it, too.
Maria knew that.
So she pulled on heavy socks, a pair of bulky boots she’d
bought the winter she’d almost—almost—decided to try skiing,
stuffed her arms through the sleeves of a warm but ugly vintage
parka she’d found at the Hell’s Kitchen flea market, secured her
wild mop of hair with a scrunchy and marched to the door.
Let His Mightiness see what kind of bed-warmer he’d bought
himself, she thought grimly.
Useless. He didn’t even blink. Instead, he motioned her
toward the steps and followed her out of the building. The snow
was still coming down but the flakes were big and slow, the kind
that normally turned the city into a wonderland.
She could see nothing wonderful about it tonight.
As they stepped off the curb a uniformed driver sprang from
behind the wheel of the big limo, touched a finger to his cap and
clicked his heels.
Maria snorted.
Alex ignored her.
“Hans,” he said.
Hans clicked his heels again. Alex thought about telling him
to stop doing that but he’d already told him the same thing at least
a dozen times. Apparently, Hans was one of those people who
dreamed of the grandeur that was royalty.
Maria, clearly, was not.
Hans reached for the bags. “I’ll put them in the trunk,” Alex
said sharply. “You see to Ms. Santos.”
Another click. Maria rolled her eyes. Hans swept open the rear
SANDRA MARTON 57
passenger door, gave her a little bow as she stepped inside the
car. The door shut with the sort of solid ‘thunk’ she figured you
expected when a car cost as much as a house. A swirl of warm
air, perfumed with the scent of expensive leather, swallowed her
up as she fell back into the soft seat.
The only thing that spoiled it was Alex, who opened the other
rear door and got in beside her.
“The airport,” he said.
The car moved gracefully from the curb. Maria’s gut moved,
too, but not gracefully. What in the world was she doing? She
had to phone Joaquin to say she was leaving, and she certainly
had to say goodbye to her mother.
“Wait!”
The car stopped. Alex turned toward her. “Whatever you
forgot,” he said coldly, “can stay right where it is.”
“No. I mean, it can’t. I mean…” She took a deep breath. “I
can’t go with you.”
Alex folded his arms. “We’ve been through all this.”
“I can’t just leave. I mean…I have to let people know. I have
to say goodbye.”
“People,” he said coldly. “You mean, your ‘friend’, Joaquin.”
She thought of correcting him, but what for? He could believe
what he liked.
“And will you tell him the intimate details of our arrangement,
glyka mou?” he said with a sly smile.
Her head came up. “I will never tell anyone about that.”
He stared at her for a long minute. For some insane reason,
he wanted to take her in his arms and tell her he would not hurt
her, that he would do all he could to bring her pleasure…
To hell with that.
“What’s his address?”
“Why?”
“Hans is an excellent driver,” Alex said with a tight smile,
“but he has one flaw. He can’t find a place unless I give him
its address.”
“Oh,” she said quickly, “no, that isn’t necessary. Just—Driver?
58 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
Driver, there’s a subway stop two blocks up. If you’d drop me
off there—and then I can, ah, I can meet you somewhere later…”
“The address,” Alex said quietly, but in a tone so filled with
authority that Maria knew she’d lost.
She sank back in her seat.
“One seven four oh Grandview Avenue,” she said in a small
voice. “That’s in the Bronx.”
“The Bronx?” the driver said.
“The Bronx,” Alex repeated firmly, and the big car started up
again.
Alex watched Maria’s face as the limo made its way along the
snow-laden streets.
She sat huddled in the corner, as far from him as she could
get, staring straight ahead, her face pale in the glaring headlights
of the few cars coming toward them. The snow had all but
emptied the city streets.
She was trembling.
He frowned. Was she cold? Impossible. The sole virtue of that
ugly jacket had to be its warmth. Besides, the car’s interior was
warm.
Shewas nervous, then. Or anxious.About agreeing to go with
him? Not that she’d actually agreed. He’d forced her into it.
Never mind.
Was she nervous about telling her lover she was going away
with another man? Alex’s jaw tightened.A week from now, hell,
a couple of hours from now, her loverwould be history. Once they
boarded his private plane, he’d take her to the big bedroom in the
rear of the cabin, strip her out of that foolish outfit and touch her
in ways that would make her forget any man but him.
That was how it had been that night.
Maria, blind with passion. Her skin, silken to the touch. Her
mouth drinking from his, her fingers cool against his body, her
hands trembling when he clasped them, brought them to his
chest, his belly, his erection.
Touch me this way, he’d murmured. Yes. Like that. Like that.
SANDRA MARTON 59
She’s never done this before, he’d thought in amazement.
And then he’d simply stopped thinking, lost in the heat that
consumed them.
What a lie!
She’d done everything before. He’d known it as soon as he
heard her on the telephone that morning. Until then, she’d had
him fooled. And that wasn’t easy. He’d been with a lot of women.
Too many, he sometimes thought; their faces and names and
bodies had become blurred over the years.
Not hers.
Maria’s name, her heart-shaped face and its delicate features,
her body that was softly curved and not a fashionable arrangement
of hard bones and flesh, even her voice…
He had forgotten nothing. She came to him in his dreams,
telling him she wanted him.
Turning yourself on again, you idiot? he thought angrily as
he shifted in the deep leather seat.
Well, there’d be no more of that.
He knew what this was all about, if he was honest. Ego?
Maybe a little. Anger? Okay, that, too. Payback? Absolutely.
But the real reason he wanted her was much more basic.
The hair of the dog that bit you. Driving out demons.
Whatever you wanted to call it. Have enough sex with Maria
Santos and he’d wipe her name, her face, everything about her
from his mind.
A month from now, he’d be happy to see the last of her.
Whether she was clever in bed or not, he’d never come across a
woman who could hold his interest for much longer than that.
This one would be no exception, not even if she went from waif
to temptress, fire to ice…
“It’s the building right over there.”
Her voice was low. Alex blinked and realized the car had
slowed to a crawl. He looked out the window and saw a nondescript
street, cars packed tightly along the curb, and a looming
wall of apartment buildings.
“This one, miss?” Hans asked.
60 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
“Sí.Yes.”
It was the first time she’d lapsed into Spanish since the phone
call—and since she’d cursed him. She sounded breathless.
Stressed. His jaw tightened. Was she nervous about visiting her
lover and telling him her plans?
If he’d been her lover, she’d have had the right to be terrified.
He could not imagine agreeing to her going off with another man
for a month. Not for a day. Not if she belonged to him.
The limo eased into the space beside a fire hydrant. The driver
turned off the engine and reached for the door handle.
“Thank you,” Maria said quickly, “but that isn’t necessary. I
can open the door my—”
“Stay in the car, Hans.” Alex’s voice was cold. “I’ll take care
of Ms. Santos.”
A blast of frigid air swept in as he opened the door. Maria’s
heart skipped a beat. Did the Prince of Arrogance think he was
going inside with her? Not in a million years.
“Thank you,” she said, forcing a polite smile, “but I can manage.”
“Don’t be silly, glyka mou. It’s late, the street is nearly
deserted. What kind of gentleman would permit a woman to be
alone under such conditions?”
His tone had gone from harsh to silken. A spider’s web was
silken, too. She didn’t want him with her, not only because then
he would know she hadn’t come to see Joaquin but because he
would know too much.
“Maria. I’m waiting.”
Hewas leaning into the car, his patrician face rigid.Anger swept
through her. Did he think he could take over every aspect of her life?
“Keepwaiting, then. I don’t require your assistance.And let me
assure you,Your Highness, if you think you are a gentleman—”
She gasped as he caught her shoulders and pulled her from
the car.
“You will not talk to me that way,” he growled. “I don’t give
a damn what you do or do not require. What matters is what I
require. For the next month, you’ll do things my way or not at
all. Is that clear?”
SANDRA MARTON 61
“Yessir,” she said, and touched her stiff fingers to her
forehead. “Of course, sir,” she added, and clicked her heels. Then
she jerked her chin up, stepped around him and marched over
the snowy sidewalk to the building’s entry.
Alex could feel his face burning.
He shot a furious glare at Hans, sitting straight as a ramrod
behind the wheel. He gave no sign that he’d seen or heard what
had just happened.
Alex took a deep breath. Then he trudged after Maria through
the snow. Her feet, in those hideous boots, moved up and down
without interference but he was wearing leather mocs—
handmade leather mocs, he thought grimly, and they were
already cold and sodden.
Great. He was about to come face to face with the man who’d
been her lover and his damned shoes would probably fall off his
feet when he…
Panagia mou!
What kind of place was this for a love nest? The entrance door
had a broken lock. The lobby smelled of mice and mildew. What
remained of a mural clung pathetically to a graffiti-scarred wall.
Therewas an elevator but Maria ignored it and headed for the stairs.
“Four flights,” she said briskly, without looking back at him.
“Are you up to that, Your Highness?”
He didn’t bother replying, he simply climbed the steps
behind her. One flight. Two. Three. At last, they reached the
fifth-floor landing.
“This is where he lives?”
Alex sounded incredulous. She hated him for that, and for
forcing himself into this part of her life.
“Answer me!” He clasped her wrist and spun her toward him.
“Your lover expects you to come to him in a dump like this?”
The door to the apartment directly ahead swung open. Alex
looked up, angry at himself, at Maria, at the unwanted intrusion.
“What the hell do you want?” he snarled at the shadowy
figure in the doorway.
The figure stepped forward into the dim light of the stairwell
62 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
landing. It was a woman. Small. Dark-haired. Wrapped in a
wool bathrobe.
“Maria?”
Maria took a deep breath. “Sí, Mama. It’s me.”
CHAPTER FIVE
IT’S ME, Mama, Maria said.
And then no one said anything.
For an eternity? For a few seconds? Alex couldn’t be sure.
The only certainty was that he’d made one hell of a mistaken
assumption.
And he’d mortified Maria. The proof was in the rigidity of her
posture, the angle of her head. This place, this depressing setting,
this woman making absolutely no move toward her daughter,
were not things she’d wanted him to see.
So what? he asked himself coldly. Wasn’t it his intention to
humiliate Maria Santos? This was just one more way to do it.
But even as he thought that he found himself moving closer
to her, putting his hand lightly on her shoulder in a gesture of
unspoken support.
The woman in the doorway spoke first. Her words were not
those of a loving mother, delighted to see her child. They were,
instead, accusatory.
“Do you have any idea how late it is, Maria? I was on my
way to bed.”
He saw the color rise in Maria’s face. His hand tightened on
her shoulder.
“I’m sorry, Mama. I should have phoned first—”
“And who is this with you? Why have you brought a man
to my home?”
64 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
“Forgive me, Mrs. Santos,”Alex said pleasantly. He gave Maria
what he hopedwas a reassuring smile, then stepped forward. “It’s
my fault, entirely. I’m afraid I was in such a hurry to get things
done that the lateness of the hour never occurred to me.”
“And you are…?”
“I am Alexandros Karedes. Prince Alexandros Karedes.”
The Santos woman’s eyebrows rose.
“Prince?”
“From the kingdom of Aristo. Perhaps you’ve heard of it,” he
said politely, knowing she would have. You could not read a
magazine or see a television program about the rich and famous
without hearing of places like Dubai, Monaco and Aristo.
“And you know my daughter?”
“Indeed. In fact, Maria and I are going to be spending the next
few weeks together.”
Maria gave him a look that should have turned him to stone.
“The prince means we’ll be working together.”
“Maria is making my mother’s birthday gift.”
Luz raised her dark eyebrows. “Maria? Is this what you meant
when I called you a little while ago?”
Alex looked at Maria. She glared even as color rose in her
cheeks. It had been her mother on the phone, not her lover. Why
did that please him? Whether she had a lover or not didn’t matter.
She would be his for the next four weeks. Who gave a damn if
she came home to Joaquin when the month ended?
“Sí, Mama, it was.”
He could almost see Luz mulling that over. Finally, she
stepped aside and motioned them forward. “Come inside. I don’t
want to bother the neighbors.”
Maria looked like a wild animal who wanted to escape a
trap, but she jerked her head in assent and moved past him into
the apartment.
The entry foyer was big; it led down two steps into a living
room that must have been elegant in its day but now was dimly lit
and depressing. Luz made no offer of coffee or tea; she took a chair
and when Maria hovered uncertainly,Alex took her elbow. He felt
SANDRA MARTON 65
her stiffen, knew she wanted to jerk free but she let him draw her
down beside him on a small, sagging, blanket-covered sofa.
“You see,” Alex said pleasantly, “my mother—”
“She is the queen?”
“Queen Tia. Yes. Her sixtieth birthday is next month, and—”
He launched into an explanation of the planned celebration.
The state dinner in the palace. The ball that would follow. The
presentation of Maria’s necklace to the queen at precisely midnight,
followed by fireworks. The fact that Mariawas accompanying him
to Aristo so she could consult personally with the queen and with
him, should questions arise about the design of the piece.
“You mean, my daughter will leave New York?”
“Yes,” Alex said politely, “but I can assure you—”
“Well, if it doesn’t worry her to leave me all alone, who am
I to complain? I am not well, Your Highness. Perhaps Maria has
mentioned it.”
“You’re fine, Mama. Your doctors say—”
“What do doctors know?” Luz crossed herself. “We can only
pray for the best. Besides, I suppose you’re determined to live
out this fantasy of yours.”
Alex could see a vein throb in Maria’s temple.
“Could we please have this discussion another time?” she
said, but Luz ignored her.
“Do you have children, Prince Alexandros?”
“I’m not married, Mrs. Santos,” Alex said politely, though
being polite was growing difficult.
“Well, when you do, you’ll understand that a mother’s sole
concern is for her child’s welfare. Maria’s cousin, Angela—”
“I’m sure the prince isn’t interested in Angela.”
“Angela is a wonderful girl. She has an excellent position with
an insurance company. She’s offered many, many times to
arrange for Maria to have an interview there. Why, only this
evening, I told Maria of Angela’s promotion. She’ll be earning
thirty thousand dollars a year!” Luz leaned toward her daughter.
“And I didn’t get the chance to tell you the rest. Angela’s
engaged. To her supervisor, can you imagine? She has done so
well for herself. It’s hard to believe you and she graduated high
school at the same time.”
The sofa was small. Maria’s thigh was against his. Alex
could feel her trembling.With anger?With despair? Not that it
mattered to him…
“We had different goals,” Maria said carefully. “Angela went
straight to work. I went to college.”
“And quit.”
“I didn’t quit, I changed schools. I went to the Fashion
Institute of Technology.” A touch of pride edged her words. “It
was not easy to get in.”
Luz made a face. “Such foolishness! Two years spent studying
what? Drawing? Making geegaws? And meanwhile, your cousin,
Angela, was—”
The hell with this, Alex thought, and he clasped Maria’s hand.
She tried to tug it away but he threaded his fingers through hers.
“Maria,” he said smoothly, “I think it’s time we told your
mother the truth.”
Her eyes went dark and wild. “Alex. Alex, please—”
“I admire your modesty, glyka mou,” he said softly, “but surely
your mother should know the details—of this commission.”
Maria let out a breath. Luz shrugged her shoulders.
“I know them already, Prince Alexandros. My daughter
entered a contest and lost. She’s won it now because the real
winner backed out.”
“You make it sound as if Maria entered a sweepstakes,
Mrs. Santos,” Alex said with a smile that barely softened the
tightly spoken words. “In fact, fifty of the world’s most
prestigious jewelry designers submitted sketches for my
father’s perusal. He and his ministers narrowed the field to
three but the final selection was the king’s.” He paused. “He
chose an excellent entry—but from the start, Maria’s design
was the queen’s choice.”
Maria’s eyes lit. “Was it?” she said softly.
Alex nodded. What was the harm in telling her the truth?
“The necklace your daughter creates will be photographed by
66 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
every major magazine. It will be featured on television news on
virtually every continent. And when the queen’s birthday celebration
ends, it will be displayed alongside the Crowns of Aristo
and Adamas, two of the most famous royal crowns in the world.”
Luz seemed to take it all in. Then she nodded and looked at
Maria.
“This is a fine opportunity, mia hija.”
“Sí, Mama. I know it is.”
“You must not squander it. Such good fortune may not come
your way again.”
Alex glanced at Maria. She had a stiff smile pinned to her lips.
He couldn’t blame her. Not that her feelings meant anything to
him, but couldn’t her mother work up a little enthusiasm? His
own mother had always been loving. Not the way mothers were
loving in the books he’d read when he was growing up, or even
in the ways he’d observed when he spent an occasional holiday
weekend with a friend from boarding school.
Tia had not tousled his hair or kissed his scraped knees; she
had not tucked him in at night or sat with him at breakfast in the
morning. He’d longed for those things as a kid but he’d understood.
She was the queen. His father was the king. His parents
had grave responsibilities; from his earliest years on, he’d been
groomed to respect that.
But Tia had applauded his every academic achievement and
sports trophy. Even Aegeus, who had always treated his children,
especially his sons, with cool removal, would have offered a
word of praise at news as important as this.
“This was more than good fortune,” he said coolly. Maria
looked at him in surprise. Hell, he’d surprised himself. “Your
daughter’s talent is the reason she won the commission.”
Maria’s counterfeit smile had given way to one that was soft
and sweet. He wanted to cup her face with his hand, taste that
sweetness, kiss her not as he had before but gently, tenderly…
A muscle knotted in his jaw.
“It’s time we left,” he said brusquely, and rose to his feet.
* * *
SANDRA MARTON 67
It had stopped snowing; the street was clear and a plow truck disappearing
just ahead, red lights blinking, was the reason.
Hans popped from the driver’s seat of the big limo and swept
the rear door open. Maria stepped in; Alex followed her.
“Where to, sir?”
What was that sound? Was Maria—was she crying?
“Sir? To the airport?”
Alex forced his attention to his driver, then dug his BlackBerry
from his pocket. There was one text message. It was from his
pilot and it was brief and to the point.
“Runways are open. Flight plan has been filed.”
“The airport,” he said briskly, and settled back in the seat.
The big car moved swiftly through the streets. Maria said
nothing; her face was turned to the window. If she’d been
weeping, she seemed to have stopped.
Alex cleared his throat.
“I forgot to leave my phone number for your mother. I’ll have
my secretary call her with it first thing tomorrow. Is there anyone
else you wish to notify?”
She shook her head.
“Not even—” He paused. Don’t, he told himself, but the need
to say it was the same as the need to touch an aching tooth, even
though you knewitwas a mistake. “Not even your friend, Joaquin?”
She swung toward him. “He is my friend,” she said fiercely,
“despite what you think. And I have my own cell phone, thank
you very much. I don’t need you or your secretary to do it for me.”
“You needn’t bite my head off. I just—I just wondered if,
perhaps—”
“Look, you did one decent thing tonight, Your Highness.
You—you tried to defend me to my mother. I suppose I owe you
my thanks for that. Just don’t—don’t spoil it.”
“I didn’t defend you. I spoke the truth. My mother loved your
design.” He hesitated. “Frankly, I agreed with her that it was the
best. Why should that be a secret?”
She lifted her chin and looked directly at him. They had just
pulled up to a traffic light. The red glow lit her lovely face with
68 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
color and yes, she had been crying. The delicate skin under her
eyes was swollen.
“If it isn’t a secret, why didn’t you tell me right away?”
Alex felt a quick stab of guilt, but why should he? Maria had
not been honest with him, and her lie of omission had been far
greater than his.
“I told you what you needed to know,” he said coldly. “There
was no reason to tell you anything more.”
She gave a little laugh. “Such diplomatic words, Alexandros.
Why, if I didn’t know better, I’d think you were a—” Her face
turned white.
“Maria?”
“Tell the driver to pull over.”
“What is it?”
“I’m going to be—”
Alex lowered the privacy screen and jerked his thumb toward
the curb. Hans steered to it and pulled up,Alex threwhis door open
and Maria shot past him. He was right on her heels; he caught her
by the shoulders as she bent over and was viciously ill.
“Go away,” she gasped. “I don’t want you to—”
Another spasm shook her. He could feel the violence of it and
his hands clasped her more tightly. When she was done, she
stood straight, her back still to him, her body racked with tremors.
“Maria,” he said softly. “Are you okay?”
She nodded. “I’m fine.”
She wasn’t. Her voice was thready and the trembling had increased.
Alex cursed and turned her toward him. She stood with
her head down.
“What happened?”
“I don’t know. Flu, I think. Everyone has it.”
God, she looked so fragile. Not silly, lost in that enormous and
ugly jacket, but terribly, heartbreakingly delicate.
He dug a handkerchief from his pocket and held it toward her.
She shook her head.
“Not your handkerchief. I’ll soil it.”
“Damn it, Maria,” he said, and put his hand under her chin,
SANDRA MARTON 69
lifted her face and dabbed her lips carefully with the snowywhite
linen.
She was still shaking.
Alex lifted her in his arms. “No,” she said, but he ignored her,
ducked his head, carried her inside the car, settled her close
against him and pressed the intercom button.
Hans answered immediately. “Sir?”
“Turn up the heat,” Alex said crisply. “And take us to the
nearest hospital.
“No,” Maria said, even more emphatically. “I don’t want to
go to a hospital.”
“You need a doctor.”
“For heaven’s sake, I was sick. Sick, that’s all. Flu. Or maybe
something I ate.”
“You look like you don’t eat enough,” Alex said, more sharply
than he’d intended but it was true. Holding her in his arms, he’d
realized she was as light as the proverbial feather.
“I am fine. I don’t need to be coddled.”
Yes, he thought, she did—but he knew that edge in her voice
by now, just as he knew the proud angle of her head.
“Okay. Great. No coddling. Hans?”
“Sir?”
“The airport.”
The intercom light blinked off. Maria stared straight ahead,
wrapped in mortification. Of all things to happen.To get sick in front
of this man. To have him insist on staying with her. To have him
wipe her face and now to be sitting within the circle of his arm…
“I am perfectly capable of sitting on my own,” she said coolly.
He let her move away. From the corner of her eye, she could
see him opening a mahogany compartment built into the side of
the car. Taking something from it. A bottle of water. A big white
linen napkin.
“Look at me,” he said as he poured the water on the napkin.
She looked. Their eyes met. What was in his? Pity? Damn it,
she didn’t want his pity. She didn’t want anything from him.
70 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
Carefully, he began to wash her face. She jerked back. He
sighed, cupped the back of her head and went right on washing.
It felt wonderful.
When he was done, she gave him a jerky nod. “Thank you,”
she said stiffly and turned away but, once again, she could see
what he was doing from the corner of her eye. Putting the water
and napkin back in the compartment. Taking out another bottle,
this one filled with an amber liquid. Taking out a crystal tumbler.
Opening the bottle, pouring the liquid into the glass…
“Drink this.”
She swung toward him. Bad idea. Everything began to spin.
The interior of the car, Alex’s face. The glass he was holding
toward her.
“Damn it,” he said, reaching for her, “you’re as white as a sheet.”
“I’m—I’m okay. I’m not going to be sick again. I’m just a
little woozy…”
Alex’s arms swept around her. “Don’t,” she said, but she was
speaking into the hardwall of his chest as he lifted her into his lap.
He was warm. Strong. He smelled of snow and cold and of
the clean male scent she remembered, had never forgotten.
“Let go of me,” she said, and hated how her voice shook but
the truth was, she felt awful. Not sick to her stomach anymore,
just cold and shaky and awful.
“Stop arguing with everything I say and drink this.”
His tone was gruff but he held her with care. Well, of course.
He certainly didn’t want to risk having her throw up all over his
magnificent automobile.
The glass was at her mouth.
“What is it?”
“Poison,” he said, but when she looked up at him, he was
smiling. “It’s brandy.”
“I don’t—”
“Yes. I know. You don’t need brandy. Well, I do.” He took a
drink from the glass, then brought it to her lips again. “For once,
just do as I ask without giving me a tough time, okay?”
The brandy smelled wonderful. She thought of how it would
SANDRA MARTON 71
feel, warm and soothing, and of how his mouth had touched the
rim of the glass…
It was safer to think about doing as he’d commanded.
She did, and knew she’d been right. The brandy was warm
and comforting. So was the man who held her. The thought,
unbidden, unexpected, set her heart racing and she pushed the
glass away.
“That’s enough.And you can let go of me. I’m perfectly fine.”
He answered by gathering her closer. “It’s late,” he said brusquely.
“And I’ve had a long day. I think you have, too. So stop
fighting me, Maria. You’re cold and shaky and I’m not at all convinced
you don’t need a doctor.”
“I already said I didn’t.”
“Then do as you’re told. Finish the brandy, put your head
against my shoulder and maybe, just maybe, I’ll believe you.”
“You’re a—a martinet,” she said bitterly. “Did anyone ever
tell you that?”
It was such an old-fashioned word that it made him laugh.
“I’ve been called a lot of things by a lot of women, glyka mou,
but that is a first.” He sank back in the seat; she had no choice
but to sink back with him. “Now close your eyes and rest. We’ll
be at the airport soon.”
Rest? She’d won a competition that had been the goal of the
world’s best jewelry designers—and handed her life over to one
of theworld’s most gorgeous, sexiest men. Howcould she possibly
rest? Surely, the man holding her had his choice of women, a different
one every night if he wished, and yet he wanted her…
Her lashes drooped.
She couldn’t rest. Or sleep. Or…
Maria sighed, burrowed closer against him, and tumbled
into sleep.
Alex felt the tension leave her. He looked down, saw the dark
shadow of her lashes against the sculpted curve of her cheek.
The woman was impossible. Argumentative. Prickly.
Sharp-tongued.
72 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
She was also beautiful and fragile and…
And, he reminded himself, she was a manipulative liar. The
sooner he had her in his bed, the better. She would not spin lies
to him there; he would not permit it. He would make love to her
until she sobbed his name, until her need for him was real, and
that would happen as soon as he had her, alone, on his plane.
But when they reached it, he carried a still-sleeping Maria
through the big cabin, to the privacy of his bedroom. Sat her on
the edge of the bed. Took off her jacket and her boots. Took off
his jacket and soggy shoes, as well.
Her eyelids fluttered but did not lift. “Alexandros?” she
murmured.
She had called him that the night they’d made love. That was
the only name he’d given her, just ‘Alexandros’. “Alex, if you
prefer,” he’d added, but not the rest.
Not that she’d needed it, he thought grimly. She had known
his identity; she had targeted him.
“Wake up,” he said coldly as he lay her back against the
pillows. She didn’t. He looked at her again. Even in sleep, she
looked exhausted. And incredibly lovely.
He lay downnext to her. Drewthe cashmere throwfrom the foot
of the bed over them both. Maria sighed in her sleep and turned
toward him.What else could he do except gather her into his arms?
SANDRA MARTON 73
CHAPTER SIX
MARIA awoke in total confusion.
Her heart thumped with terror. Where was she?
Everything about this room was wrong. The bed. The faint
light stealing in through the window. Even the feel of the silk
bed linen under her cheek, the whisper-weight of the blanket…
The pillow beside hers. Indented, as if someone’s head had
rested on it. A faint scent. Clean. Crisp. Male.
“Ohmygod,” she whispered, and shot up against the pillows.
A bad move. Her stomach did a slow roll. She bolted from the
bed, looked around wildly, saw the bathroom and barely got
there in time.
She retched until the muscles of her diaphragm ached.
Shaken and shaking, she closed her eyes and sank down on the
cold tile floor.
Easy, she told herself, just take it easy.
Seconds later, she stood, washed her face, unscrewed the top
from a small bottle of mouthwash and rinsed her mouth until the
bottle was empty.
Boneless, on legs that seemed to be made of over-cooked
pasta, she sank down on the closed commode.
She remembered it all. Alex’s arrival. The royal commission.
The awful visit to Luz, the humiliation of being sick afterward…
Most of all, the unbelievable proposition Alex had made—and
she had accepted.
SANDRA MARTON 75
Was this a hotel room?As if in answer, the floor seemed to give
a gentle dip. Not a hotel room. Thiswas his plane. They were somewhere
over the ocean and she couldn’t even remember getting on
board. Her memory took her as far as being sick in the snow. Alex
cradling her in his arms. The warming swallows of brandy.
Maria groaned and buried her face in her hands.
Had she slept with him? No. Heat flooded her body. Definitely,
no. If Alex had made love to her— Correction. If they’d had sex,
she’d remember. Besides, except for her jacket and boots, shewas
still dressed in the ratty outfit she’d worn last night.
Somehow, the thought that she’d slept between silk sheets and
beneath what was probably a cashmere blanket dressed like this
made her want to laugh.
God, she was coming apart! Aches where she’d never had
aches. Laughter that could just as easily turn to tears. Nausea
when she least expected it. Joaquin was right. She’d been
working too hard. Stress could do terrible things.
She rose to her feet. There was a stall shower. A big terrycloth
robe hanging from a hook. Shampoo and soap and—
And Alex, just outside the bedroom door.
How was she going to face him? What was she going to say?
Could she ask him if he’d slept with her? Well, not with her. In
the same bed. Not that it mattered. He had the right. Hadn’t she
agreed to share his bed, and not just for sleep?
It was a miracle he hadn’t held her to that unspoken agreement
already, but then a woman who tossed her cookies at a
man’s feet wasn’t exactly a turn-on. Not that she wanted to turn
him on. Not that she wanted him to undress her, touch her, carry
her to his bed and do more, much more than sleep next to her…
Someone knocked at the door. The knob rattled. Maria swung
around and stared as if it were a live thing about to launch an attack.
“Ms. Santos?” A woman’s voice. “Ms. Santos?”
She took a deep breath. “Yes?”
The door opened. A pleasant-faced woman of about fifty
smiled at her.
“Good morning, Ms. Santos. I’m Thalia. The stewardess. The
prince asked me to tell you we’ll be landing in a couple of hours.
He asks that you join him for breakfast.”
Maria felt her face heat. “Thank you.”
“I’ve left your bag at the foot of the bed.”
Could her cheeks get any hotter? “Fine. Thank you again.”
Thalia smiled, stepped out of the room and shut the door
behind her. Maria flew to it and turned the lock.
How could she face anyone? She’d all but died of humiliation
just now and there were other people to deal with. The pilot.
A co-pilot. Half the kingdom of Aristo, for all she knew. So
what? the logical part of her said. Common sense assured her
that Prince Alexandros had a long tradition of having women
travel with him and share his bed.
The knowledge would come as no shock to anyone.
Yes, but it came as a shock to her. She had never been a
mistress before.
The fact was, she had never been with a man before that
night two months ago. Not that His Royal Arrogance would
believe it if she told him. Not that she would tell him. Her humiliation
was already devastating enough. Why make it worse?
Far better to let him think that she was as experienced as he obviously
believed.
Why hadn’t she thought of that sooner?
Maria stripped off her clothes and stepped into the shower.
Alex had called her a liar. She wasn’t, but she could carry
things off when she had to. Hadn’t she prepped for the interview
at FIT without letting her mother know? And then there’d
been the interview itself, when she’d sat in a waiting room like
an ugly duckling lost in a bevy of swans. And years later, after
she’d won the Caligari prize and approached a buyer at a posh
Fifth Avenue store with a small box filled with earrings of her
own design…
Oh yes, she thought as she tilted her face up to the spray, yes,
she could do this. Pretend that being his sex toy for a month
meant nothing. Not a problem.
Not at all.

76 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
Where in blazes was Maria?
Alex had awakened hours ago.Awakened? His mouth twisted.
Hehad not really slept.Howcould amansleep with awoman curled
against him, her breath warm and light against his throat, her hand
on his chest? Maria had curved her body into his as if she’d belonged
there. He’d told himself it didn’t affect him and it hadn’t…
For about thirty seconds.
Then, he’d gone into a full state of arousal.
He’d imagined rolling her onto her back. Undressing her.
Caressing her. Imagined her waking slowly as she felt his hands
and mouth moving gently on her flesh.
“Alexandros?” she’d have whispered, as she had that night
they’d spent together, as she had just a little while ago, when he’d
put her to bed, and he’d have said, Yes, it’s Alexandros. Say my
name again, Maria. Touch me with your cool hands. Open your
mouth so I can taste your sweetness…
That was when he’d shot from the bed.
A cold shower. A change of clothes. Then he’d left the room
without a backward glance because he hadn’t trusted himself.
He’d waited weeks for this. He wasn’t going to take her now,
when she was exhausted and sick and only half aware of him.
He wanted her wide awake when he possessed her, wanted
her eyes on his as he took what she had only pretended to give
him that first time.
His flight crew, of course, had asked no questions, nor had Thalia
when he’d told her to inform his guest that they’d be landing soon.
“Is Ms. Santos awake?” he’d asked brusquely, when Thalia
brought him coffee.
“Yessir. I gave her your message.”
Alex looked at his watch. Fifteen minutes had gone by. What
was taking her so long? Did she think she could stay locked in
the bedroom? That she could put off what would happen next?
The hell she could.
They’d land soon, his car would be waiting. He would drive
to his apartment in Ellos and take her to his bed.
He looked at his watch again. He was weary of playing her
SANDRA MARTON 77
games. He put down his coffee cup. Blotted his lips with a linen
napkin. There was still time to assert his possession now…
The door at the rear of the cabin opened. Maria stood framed
within it; her eyes met his. He saw her take a breath and then she
started toward him. The ugly sweats and boots had been replaced
by a pale gray long-sleeved sweater that fell to her hips, black
tights and pale gray ankle boots. Her hair, still damp, tumbled
around her shoulders.
His gut tightened. By God, shewas beautiful.And composed.
He had not expected that. The fact was, he wasn’t sure what
he’d expected. Tears, maybe. Pleas that he send her home. He’d
judged wrong. The look on her facewas a study in self-assurance.
“Good morning,” he said, and rose to his feet. He gestured to
the chair opposite his. She took it, plucked the napkin from under
the heavy silverware and spread it in her lap. “How do you feel?”
“I’m fine. I’m sorry about last night—”
“That you slept curled in my arms?”
“That I got sick,” she said quickly, but the tiniest bit of color
crept into her face.
So. Perhaps she wasn’t as self-confident as she appeared.
“I’m just happy a night’s sleep helped. I tried not to disturb
you when I left the bed,” he said, pouring coffee for her. He
glanced at her, to see what effect his deliberate use of the word
‘bed’ had made. None. None at all. Her expression was impersonal
again. “You were curled so tightly in my arms that I had
to disentangle us.”
There it was again. That little rush of color. She shot him a
look, then buried it in a sip of coffee. She swallowed, looked up.
The tip of her tongue peeped out; she swiped it over her lips. To
his annoyance, he felt his body stir.
“I was sure I’d wake you when I took my arm out from around
your shoulders.”
She looked straight at him. “I thought your stewardess said
we’d be landing soon.”
“A change of subject, agapimeni?” His tone was pure silk.
78 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
“Did you want to discuss something other than the fact that you
slept with me last night?”
“We shared the same bed,” she said, looking him straight in the
eye. “I’m sure you know the difference between that and what
people mean when they say they slept together.” Her lips compressed.
“Besides, I didn’t know I rated a change of subject. I
thought mistresses were expected to comply with the wishes of
their masters. That is what I will be, isn’t it?Your mistress? I mean,
isn’t that what one calls a woman who warms a man’s bed?”
Damn it! He was the one who could feel his face filling with
heat. What a hell of a little speech, and had she deliberately
waited until Thalia was in earshot? His stewardess had been
with him for years; if asked, he’d have said nothing could rattle
her but hadn’t her eyebrows just taken a surprised lift?
Alex tossed his napkin on the table and got to his feet.Two could
play at this game of control—but only one would be the winner.
“We’ll be on the ground soon,” he said coldly. “And then
there’ll be plenty of time for me to make my wishes clear—and
for you to make absolutely certain you comply with them.”
The last time Maria had come to Aristo, the only time, had been
in early December, the start of the Mediterranean winter.
The plane had taxied to a jet way; she’d disembarked along
with scores of other travel-weary coach passengers and sleepwalked
through the terminal to a luggage carousel where she’d
waited for her suitcase to thump its way toward her. Then she’d
headed outside and waited in line for a taxi.
Arriving in the kingdom with a prince of the Royal House of
Karedes was very different.
Alex’s jet landed and taxied to an area far from the busy
terminal. Two men wheeled a staircase to the door. The captain
and co-pilot left the cockpit and saluted as she and Alex moved
past them; Thalia dropped a little curtsy toAlex and smiled at her.
“Enjoy your stay, miss.”
Alex slid his arm around her waist. “I’ll see to it Ms. Santos
enjoys every minute.”
SANDRA MARTON 79
Was she the only one who heard the ironic undertone in his
words? She couldn’t tell; Thalia’s face showed nothing but Maria
felt a tinge of heat wash into hers.
No, she told herself fiercely, no! She would not let him take
control again. Determinedly, she shrugged free of his encircling
arm and went down the stairs.
In December, the Aristan skies had been a brilliant blue and the
day unseasonably warm. Now, in early February, the air held a
distinct chill. Just as chillingwas the sight of the uniformed chauffeur
standing at attention beside a black limousine even more
imposing than the one that had ferried them around NewYork.
A shudder went through her, and Alex immediately took off
his leather jacket and wrapped it around her shoulders.
“I don’t need that,” she said, trying to shrug it away, but he
clasped the collar, brought the edges together and, in doing so,
drew her closer.
“But you do, agapimeni,” he said, smiling though the smile
never reached his eyes. “Besides, didn’t you just tell me the first
rule a mistress must follow is compliance?”
“Don’t count your chickens before they hatch,” Maria said
coolly. “I’m not your mistress yet.”
His eyes grew darker than midnight.
“You will be, glyka mou,” he said huskily. “And very soon.”
He brushed a strand of hair from her cheek and hooked it
behind her ear. His gaze fell to her lips. Was he going to kiss her,
despite the people watching from the top of the stairs and the
chauffeur waiting beside the car?
If he did—if he did, she would stand straight and still within
his arms and give him nothing in return.
“Did you hear what I said, Maria? An hour from now, you’ll
be in my bed.”
Her pulse rocketed. It took all her strength to respond with
what she hoped was a cool smile.
“Thank you for the warning, Your Highness. It’s always
helpful to be prepared for something unpleasant.”
To her amazement, Alex laughed.
80 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
“Very nicely done.” His hands swept into her hair and he tilted
her face to his. “But a sad little lie.” His smile faded. “Tell me
how unpleasant it is after I have you undressed,” he whispered.
“Say it when my mouth is at your breast, when it is between your
thighs. Tell me then, glyka mou, and I might just believe you.”
She felt her nipples peak, felt the swift rush of desire spear
low in her belly. He seemed to know what effect his words had
because he bent his head and gave her a quick, possessive kiss.
“Get in the car, agapi mou,” he said, and the look of satisfaction
on his hard, beautiful face made her wonder who she hated
the most, Alex or herself.
The car moved swiftly through the streets of Ellos.
Alex was on his cell phone, talking softly as buildings flashed
by. She recognized the small hotel she’d stayed at, the busy street
where she’d first met him. The romantic restaurant he’d taken her
to, the little park where he’d kissed her.
He’d told the truth, she thought, and drew a shaky breath. He’d
have her in his bed very soon. His apartment was only a couple
of blocks away.
But the car didn’t take the turn that would have brought
them there.
Where was he taking her, then?
She threw him a glance. He’d put the phone away; he sat with
his arms folded over his chest, looking distant and formidable,
and she decided she’d sooner die than ask. Besides, what did it
matter? Maybe he had rules for this kind of thing. Or maybe he
didn’t want her in his apartment. Maybe there was another
woman there already. Or maybe he preferred to keep his women
in a hotel.
The limo swooped up a ramp and onto a highway. A sign in
both Greek and English flashed by.
To the North Coast Beaches and the Bay of Apollonia.
Beaches? Bays? Shewas a city girl. Streets, noise, traffic were
her natural habitat. Beaches and bays sounded foreign. Isolated.
“Aren’t we going to your apartment?”
SANDRA MARTON 81
She spoke without thinking, regretted it almost immediately,
but Alex had a ready reply.
“We were, but I changed my mind. I’m taking you to a place
where your compliance will be assured.”
Her heart skipped a beat. She thought of telling him he wasn’t
funny but that would be a sign of surrender, and the last thing
this man would have from her was surrender.
Her refusal to bend to his will was all she had left, and she
was intent on keeping it.
The drive took what seemed a very long time.
They had reached the bay; the sign at the exit said so but the
proof was in the spectacular view from a road that now hugged
high, curving cliffs above sand so white it looked as if it were
made of crushed pearls. Beyond that stretched a sea of deep, brilliant
blue, so beautiful it took her breath away.
All right. She had to break her self-imposed silence.
“Is that the Bay of Apollonia?”
Alex nodded. “Named for the god, Apollo. Legend says that
Virgil wrote a poem about this place some two thousand years ago.”
“Virgil? But he was Roman.”
“Aristo and its sister island, Calista, were first part of the
Greek Empire and then were ruled by Rome. You’re familiar
with Virgil?”
Maria stiffened. “I might not have had your tutors and private
schools, Alexandros, but the New York City schools provided me
with an excellent education.”
“I didn’t mean to imply…”
“Yes. You did. You don’t know a thing about me but you have
no trouble jumping to all kinds of conclusions.”
“I might say the same of you, glyka mou.”
Maria looked at him. “You mean,” she said sweetly, “you
didn’t have tutors? You didn’t go to private schools?”
“Well, no. I mean, I did—but I have to admit, I tuned out most
of what I learned in Latin III, whichwas pretty much when we dealt
withVirgil. I guess I’m just surprised you didn’t do the same.”
82 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
He grinned, and it instantly transformed him from cold despot
to the gorgeous, easygoing man she’d met that night two months
ago. She didn’t want that. Didn’t want to remember that night,
how he’d made her feel when he’d made love to her.
“Anyway, yes, Virgil wrote about the Bay of Apollonia. He
called it an ambrosial sea of sapphire.”
How could she not reply to that? Maria sighed and gazed out
at the bay again.
“He was right,” she said softly, “though I’ve never seen a
sapphire that magnificent. But if I did—”
“If you did?”
“I’d use it as the center stone in a ring. I’d make the setting
of twenty-four-karat gold to suggest the brilliance of the sun, and
mount the sapphire between a pair of small, perfect diamonds to
represent the sister islands of Aristo and Calista.”
“They’re not that anymore,” Alex said, a bit grimly. “The
unified kingdom of Adamas is just a memory until, if and when
the islands are somehow reunited.”
“Is that what people hope will happen?”
“It’s what King Christos hoped would happen when he gave
dominion of one island to his daughter, Anya, and the other to
my father, Aegeus.”
“Was that when Christos had the Stefani diamond split in two?”
Alex raised an eyebrow. “You’ve done your homework.”
“Did you think I designed the necklace for your mother out
of nothing? Of course I did my homework. I know the diamond
was the biggest pink diamond ever mined on Calista, that it dates
to the time of Richard the Lionheart and that it was the center of
the crown of Adamas until it was cut in half in ninety seventyfour.”
Maria flushed. “I don’t know why I’m telling you all this
when you already know it.”
The lady was full of surprise, Alex thought, watching her in
silence for a little while. Then he cleared his throat.
“What will you do with the money from the commission?”
“What will I do with it?” Her disbelieving tone suggested he’d
lost his mind.
SANDRA MARTON 83
“Yes. Surely, it’s enough to buy the perfect sapphire, the
perfect diamonds—”
“You mean, it’s enough to put a down payment on my loft.
Buy some new equipment. Pay some overdue bills. Pay some
bills for my mother, maybe even convince her to move to a nicer
place.” She gave a rueful laugh. “That’s what I’ll do with the
commission.”
“You support your mother?”
Maria gave a little shrug. “She isn’t up to working.”
“Surely, she could—”
“She doesn’t think so. And I owe her. She sacrificed everything
for me…”
“You can’t really believe that,” he said, a touch of anger in
his words.
“What does it matter? I do what must be done, Your Highness,
the same as most people, but what would you know about that,
in your world?”
“That’s unfair.”
“Is it?” Her lips stretched in a smile. “You show up at my door.
You give me the most wonderful news imaginable.”
“And that’s bad?”
“Then you tell me the only way this—this miracle will happen
is if I agree to sleep with you.”
His eyes narrowed. “Trying to get out of our deal, Maria?” He
moved quickly, covered the distance between them and caught
her by the elbows. “All I did was turn the tables,” he said in a low
voice. “You set the trap the first time. Now it’s my turn.”
Maria could feel the sting of angry tears. She didn’t want to
cry in front of him!
“Let go of me.”
“Why? Because you don’t like the truth?”
“You wouldn’t know the truth if it bit you! There was no trap!
You seduced me.”
“I seduced you the way a chicken seduces a fox! You were
good, I have to admit. I really believed you were a shy Miss
Innocent lost on the streets of a strange city.”
84 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
“Bastardo!” Maria hissed.
Alex slid his hands to her wrists, clamped them hard and
dragged her toward him.
“You knew who I was. You intended to use me.” His eyes
narrowed. “Now I’m going to use you.”
He bent his head and took her mouth, his kiss hard and demanding
and she hated him, hated the touch of his hands, the feel
of his mouth. Hated, hated, hated…and then she stopped thinking
and fell into the kiss.
He felt it happen. Knew the moment she let go—and then his
arms were around her, she was in his lap, his hand was under her
sweater, his mouth was feeding on hers and it was as it had been
that night, the hot need, the drowning passion, the desire to take
and take and never let her go…
His cell phone rang.
Slowly, Alex came back to the world. The car had stopped.
He cupped Maria’s shoulders, put her from him. Her eyes opened
slowly; he saw in them everything he’d seen that night. Surprise.
Desire. Even the innocence he damned well knew wasn’t real.
Angrily, he yanked the phone from his pocket and flipped it open.
“Alexandros? Are you there?”
His father’s voice buzzed in his ear. “Ne,” he said, clearing his
throat.Aegeus talked.Alex listened.Yes, he said again, yes, all right.
But his eyes never left Maria’s face. The way she was looking
at him, the way her lips were parted. He wanted to reach for her
when the call ended. She knew it; he could see it, feel it. She was
ready for him. God, yes, she was ready.
But hewasn’t a fool. Hewould be in control this time, not she.
The Mercedes slowed. Ahead, elaborate wrought-iron
security gates swung slowly open. The car moved under a long
archway of tall cedars and came to a stop in a circular drive
before a magnificent glass and cedar mansion.
“Where are we?” Maria said warily.
“Bluebeard’s castle,” Alex said wryly. “My home, Maria.
My housekeeper expects you. Go inside. See if everything is
as you wish.”

“I don’t under—”
“There’s been a change of plans. I have work to do. I’ll be
back this evening. Six o’clock. We have a dinner appointment.
Be ready. I do not like to be kept waiting.”
The commands were flung at her like stones from a slingshot.
Maria lifted her chin and glared.
“I have no interest in playing games, Your Highness, or going
on pretend dates.”
A smile spread across his lips. “In such a hurry to get to bed,
glyka mou?” Her cheeks colored and he gave the kind of laugh
she knew she would never forget. “It’s hardly a date,” he said
brusquely. “My parents want to meet the winner of the royal commission.”
He wrapped his hand around the back of her neck, drew
her to him and kissed her, hard and deep. “One final reprieve,
agapimeni, and then, rest assured, you will share my bed.”
CHAPTER SEVEN
ALEX’S driver deposited Maria’s suitcase beside her, saluted
briskly and strode back to the limousine.
Wait, Maria almost said, but what would be the point? There
was something intimidating about being delivered to the massive
front doors of a mansion where she knew no one, but getting back
into the car beside a man who’d just kissed her senseless wasn’t
much of an alternative.
She could hear the purr of the big car’s engine as it went
down the drive. She took a deep breath, raised a hand toward
the bell. The doors swung open before she could touch it and a
small woman dressed head to toe in crisp black cotton stood
looking at her.
Wonderful. This had to be the housekeeper. Did she bear
more than a passing resemblance to the one in that old movie
about Young Frankenstein? Then the woman smiled, dipped a
knee, and was instantly transformed from wicked witch to a welcoming
committee of one.
“Kalimera, Keeria. Onomázome Athenia.”
“I’m afraid I don’t speak Greek—”
“Of course. Forgive me. Good morning, madam, and
welcome. I am Athenia. The prince has told me to make sure you
are comfortable.”
Did he leave the same orders for all his mistresses?
“Thank you.”
88 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
Athenia clapped her hands. A manservant appeared, inclined
his head to Maria and scooped up her suitcase.
“Really,” Maria said, with a little laugh, “no one has to bow
to me. I’m not a royal or anything like that.”
“You are the prince’s guest and the lady who is to create a
beautiful gift for our beloved queen. We are honored by your
presence, keeria.” The housekeeper stepped back. “Please, won’t
you come in?”
What would happen to Athenia’s warm welcome if she knew
that Alex’s esteemed guest had also made a devil’s bargain with
him? There was no sense in thinking about it. She was here, and
she would do what had to be done.
“Thank you,” Maria said again, and stepped into a cool, slatefloored
entryway. One quick glance assured her this house would
never be confused with Bluebeard’s castle.
“Would you like something to drink? Something to eat? I
know you have had a long journey.”
Just the mention of food and Maria’s belly did a nasty little
flip-flop.
“No,” she said quickly, “no, thank you. I’m not hungry.”
“Then,would you like me to showyou to your room?”Athenia
nodded toward a spiraling staircase that seemed suspended in the
air. “Or would you prefer to see your workshop first?”
Her room? What the housekeeper meant was the prince’s
room. Unbidden, a tremor of what surely had to be apprehension
danced along Maria’s skin.
“Uh, no,” she said, a little breathlessly. “I mean…I mean, my
workshop will be here?”
“It will. I hope you will like it. His Highness gave very
specific orders but we had so little time…”
The Prince of Arrogance’s specialty, Maria thought grimly.
Handing out orders. Giving people little time to obey, much less
question. And why would she be working here? What had he
done? Put a bench in the basement? Hung a work light over it?
She’d have everything she needed, he’d said.
“If you would please come this way…?”
SANDRA MARTON 89
Maria followed the housekeeper through a series of magnificent,
high-ceilinged rooms. Despite her irritation, the artist in her
could not help but see the house’s incredible beauty.
The lifestyles of the rich and famous, she thought wryly.
Always and forever amazing.
She knew how they lived. She was a NewYorker; her life and
those of the fantastically wealthy were completely separate but,
in Manhattan, you brushed shoulders all the time even if it was
only at the Bobbi Brown counter at Saks. And if you knew
somebody who knewsomebody who knewsomebody who could
get you into a promotional party for Vogue or Vanity Fair—and
she did—you could even get up-close-and-personal glimpses of
that kind of storied existence. An old classmate from FIT, a guy
who now designed incredible floral displays, had edged her onto
a couple of those guest lists, though attending the parties had
never snagged her a client.
Still, nothing she’d seen compared to this.
Maria tried not to stare as she followedAthenia throughAlex’s
home. The mansion was spectacular but she had to give him
grudging credit. It had not been built to impress, though it surely
did, but to celebrate thewooded setting, the sapphire bay, the white
sand beach.Walls were made of glass. Almost all the rooms had
terraces or balconies, and the water from an enormous infinity
pool seemed to spill into a sea that stretched to the horizon.
Athenia led her out a pair of glass French doors. Apparently,
her workshop was not in the house. Maybe the mighty prince
thought she could make his mother’s birthday gift in the garage,
Maria thought irritably as they made their way along a flagstone
path that wound through a dormant garden.
The housekeeper turned to her and smiled.
“Your workshop, keeria.”
Maria blinked in surprise.
Ahead, in a grove of firs, stood a perfect miniature of the main
house. Wood. Glass. Soaring rooflines, terraces, white sand and
blue water a dizzying distance below.
“This is normally a guesthouse but the prince was very
specific about your needs. We worked quickly to meet them, but
if anything is not to your liking…”
Not to her liking? Maria almost laughed as they stepped inside.
The guesthouse had three rooms. A bedroom. A marble
bathroom. And a main room, big and high-ceilinged and brightly
lit, a room that had been filled with oak worktables and benches,
with shelves that held tools she had dreamed of buying but only
in a distant, far more affluent future. A quick glance revealed
heated presses, torches, hand tools and protective gear, all of it
straight out of a jewelry maker’s dreams.
And there were cabinets.
Cabinets with drawers and cubby-holes and shelves. Cabinets
that opened to reveal all the things she could possibly need to
create Queen Tia’s necklace. Waxes. Molds. Polishes. Trays of
bright gold and platinum and silver.
And one special tray that made her heartbeat quicken.
“Shall I leave you here, miss?” Athenia said.
Maria nodded. And reached for that special tray. Lined in
black silk, its small compartments burned with the fire of the brilliant
white and pink diamonds she had so carefully described in
her proposal as the only ones suitable for the queen’s gift.
The stones glittered with life.
Carefully matched white diamonds from a mine in the
Canadian Yukon, where there was no danger of them having
been involved in the blood conflicts of the world. And two magnificent
pink diamonds, so exquisite they could only be from the
fabulous mines of Calista.
Maria lifted the pink stones from their silken compartments.
She would only use one as the centerpiece of the necklace. In
her proposal, she’d pointed out that pink diamonds, that all
diamonds, had slight differences in color.
Obviously, King Aegeus had decided to provide her with two
stones so she could choose the one she preferred. The implications
of such wealth were almost beyond comprehension.
The pinks were easily forty karats each, just as she had requested.
She had determined the size she’d need by estimating
90 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
that the Stefani diamond, in its original form, was said to have
weighed approximately one hundred and ninety carats, meaning
it had been even bigger than the fabled Darya-ye Noor, a pale
pink diamond that had been mined in India hundreds of years ago
and then became part of the Persian crown jewels.
Thus, the half of the Stefani pink diamond now in the Aristan
crown would weigh somewhere around eighty carats, since some
material would have been lost when the stone was split. The pink
diamond that would be the focal point in the queen’s necklace
would have to be of a size to complement the one in the crown.
These incredible pink ovals would look the same to the untrained
eye, but Maria could see a slight variation in color. The
only way to choose the proper stone for the queen’s necklace
would be to check both against the pink diamond in the crown.
The palace had provided her with photos of it but no photo could
capture the soul of a diamond, or the subtleties of its color, especially
when it was half of the legendary Stefani stone.
Carefully, she returned the pink diamonds to their tray. Her
design couldn’t be changed now, nor did she want to change it, but
diamonds, born in the extreme pressure and heat of the earth’s
forming crust millions of years ago, all had their own characteristics.
Her plans needed simple refining. Nothing anyone but she
would notice.Afiligree of gold here, a millimeter less in depth there.
First, though, she had to call Joaquin and Sela and let them know
she was all right. She hadn’t had the chance to do it last night…
Better not to think about that.
She used her cell phone, left a brief message about the commission
on their voice mail, with no mention of the very personal
contract terms that involved the prince.
“I’m very happy,” she said. And, at the moment, that was the
truth. She had the perfect workshop. The best tools. And the most
magnificent diamonds imaginable.
Maria hitched her hip onto a stool, pulled a pad and pencil
toward her and began to sketch. Yes, she thought as she lost
herself in the work she loved, she could make her design even
more pleasing to the eye. And thinking about diamonds was far
SANDRA MARTON 91
safer than thinking about the man to whom she’d all but sold
herself. The man who would claim her later tonight, who would
take her to his bed, make love to her as he had all those weeks
ago. She would hold back, hold back…but, in the end, she knew
she would sob his name, open her mouth, her body to his. She
would be lost in his arms, in his strength and beauty and passion.
She forced the treacherous thoughts from her mind, put all her
energy into her ideas for the necklace and the diamonds. They,
at least, would never hurt her.
The sun shifted in the sky. She never noticed. She sketched,
erased, sketched… And yawned. Yawned again. She was tired
all the time lately. This time, at least there was a reason. It had
to be jet lag, catching up to her.
As she had done many times over the last couple of weeks,
Maria set her work aside, folded her arms on the table, lowered
her head and rested her cheek on them.
Just a few seconds, to clear the cobwebs from her brain, she
thought. Just a few seconds…
Jet lag, Alex kept telling himself. That was why he felt so
damned irritable.
Besides, it was unreasonable for his father to have demanded
a meeting now, but that was Aegeus’s way. What the king wished,
others must do. And today, this very afternoon, what Aegeus
wished was to meet with his three sons and discuss plans for the
construction of another high-rise complex in Ellos.
There was no point to such a discussion.
For one thing, the construction was already underway. For
another, Alex was in charge of the project. He had taken over development
on Aristo more than eight years ago, with Aegeus’s
grudging blessing.
“You might as well get some use out of that MBA of yours,”
he’d said, which was as close as he’d ever come to acknowledging
that his second son was now more qualified than he to oversee
the kingdom’s booming economy.
This meetingwas just a not so subtle reminder thatAegeuswas
92 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
still Aegeus, Alex thought as he sat at the conference table in the
king’s palace office. As if any of them could ever forget that.
“…twenty stories, Alexandros, but why not thirty?”
Alex looked up from the doodles he’d been making on the
yellow notepad before him. Aegeus’s eyes were focused on him.
His younger brother, Andreas, seated beside him, nudged Alex’s
foot with his under the table. His older brother, Sebastian, seated
opposite, raised his eyebrows.
“Didn’t you say the architect agrees that twenty stories for the
center building would be right, Alex?” he said smoothly.
“Yes,” Andreas chimed in, “twenty stories so that the view of
the harbor would not be blocked from the condominium complex
on the heights, right, Alex?”
“That’s correct,” Alex replied. Sebastian grinned. You owe us,
big time, that grin said. Well, hell. That was how it had always
been, the three brothers bailing each other out of hot water when
their father turned a stern eye on any one of them.
Aegeus looked grim, but then he looked that way most of the
time. He looked tired, too, Alex noticed, and thinner than usual.
“Are you feeling all right, Father?” he said.
The king’s eyes narrowed. “I’m feeling fine, thank you,” he
said brusquely. “Fine enough to ask a few more questions—that
is, if you can manage to keep your attention on our discussion a
bit longer.”
Alex felt a muscle knot in his jaw. “What else do you want to
know, Father?”
“Have you settled the woman in?”
“Excuse me?”
“The woman. Mary Santos. Is she settled in?”
“Her name is Maria,” Alex said carefully. “And I thought we
were talking about the Ellos convention center.”
“We were. Now we’re talking about the person who’ll make
your mother’s gift. What is she like?”
“She is, ah, she is talented.”
Talented, indeed.
“I assumed that,” his father said impatiently. “But what is she
SANDRA MARTON 93
like? I am to meet her tonight, at dinner.Will she be able to carry
on a conversation with some intelligence, or is she one of those
leftover flower children who walks around barefoot?”
Sebastian coughed. Andreas cleared his throat. Alex shot them
both looks that promised trouble when they were alone.
“She’s a designer, Father,” he said carefully. “A New Yorker.
I’m sure you’ll find her interesting and able to hold her own at
the dinner table.”
And more than able to hold her own everywhere else. In bed,
for instance, where he should have been with her, right now.
“I assume you’ve put her in a suite at The Grand Hotel.”
“No.” Alex hesitated. “I, ah, I decided to keep her at my house
at Apollonia.”
His father stared at him. So did his brothers. Damn it, Alex
thought, and felt heat rise in his face.
“Security,” he said quickly. “She’ll be working with a fortune
in diamonds.”
“Have we security problems at The Grand?”
“No, of course not. But there are so many tourists…”
“Tourists who pay a thousand Euros a night for a room are
not tourists likely to dabble in theft,” Aegeus said, his words
heavy with sarcasm.
There was a moment’s silence. Then Sebastian and Andreas
spoke at the same time.
“You can never be too sure,” Andreas said.
“Remember that incident in—where was it, Alex? Some hotel
in Manhattan?”
His brothers had redeemed themselves. “Exactly,” Alex
said. “Security is much better at my place. The gates. The
electronics. The guards. I had my guesthouse converted into a
workshop for her.”
Aegeus nodded. “Well. Well, yes. Good thinking.”
A compliment. Something rare. Of course, it was a compliment
given in response to a lie. He’d placed Maria in his home
for reasons that didn’t have a thing to do with anything but lust.
He liked women. He liked sex. He knew what desire was,
94 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
how anticipation could enhance the moment when a man finally
took a woman.
But he’d never behaved like this.
Demanding Maria’s compliance. Damned near forcing her to
agree to sleep with him. It had made sense, when he’d planned
it. He would use her for his own ends as she had used him—
If that was true, why was his body in this almost constant state
of arousal? He’d spent the last hours thinking about her.
Imagining her waiting for his arrival. Imagining what he would
do when he reached home.
The images, hot and raw, flooded his mind. If he didn’t do
something soon, he was going to explode.
“Alex? Are you listening to me? I said—”
“Father.” Alex pushed back his chair and got to his feet. “I’m
sorry, but I have to leave.”
Aegeus looked at him in disbelief. “You what?”
“I said I have to—”
“We have not finished discussing the convention center.”
“We finished discussing it three months ago,”Alex said crisply.
His father glared at him. “I don’t like your tone.”
“My apologies, Father. I’m exhausted, that’s all. I’ve flown
to New York and back in, what, less than twenty-four hours.”
He forced a smile. “Perhaps we can put off this conversation
until tomorrow.”
Aegeus studied his middle son, then nodded.
“Very well.” He rose from his chair. Sebastian and Andreas
immediately did the same. “Be prompt for dinner tonight, please.
All of you. Alex, tell Ms. Santos your mother and I look forward
to meeting her.”
Alex started toward the door. The king called after him.
“Alex? My initial concern about this woman, on reading her
proposal, was that she was too young and inexperienced. Now
that you’ve spent a bit of time with her, what do you think? How
does she strike you?”
Spectacularly beautiful. And spectacularly immoral. And,
Thee mou, so desirable he ached to possess her.
SANDRA MARTON 95
“I told you,” Alex said calmly. “She’s very interesting.”
Then he got the hell out of there before his father or, worse,
his brothers could ask him any more questions.
The drive home seemed to last an eternity, even though he was
at the wheel of his Ferrari and took both the highway and then
the winding road to the house at breakneck speed.
Would she be waiting for him? He’d told her to be ready by
six; he was an hour early. She might be in the bath. Or undressing,
baring her flesh to the waning afternoon light.
Such schoolboy fantasies, and completely demolished
when Athenia told him Keeria Santos was in the guesthouse.
In the workshop.
The workshop, he thought as he strode down the path to it.
Of course. The only allegiance, the only honesty she had was
to her work.
It filled him with a rage he knew had no basis in reality.
She should have been in the house. In his bedroom. Dressing
for dinner, as he’d told her to. Or waiting for him. For his touch.
For the act thatwould avenge what she had done to him weeks ago.
“Maria,” he barked as he flung open the guesthouse door.
“Maria, I told you…”
Andhe sawher.At theworkbench. Her head on her arms.Asleep.
His anger drained away. He felt something new take its place,
something he could not name and he swallowed hard, closed the
door quietly and stoodwatching her. Then, slowly, hewalked to her.
Her head was turned to the side. Her lashes formed dark crescents
against the high arc of her cheekbones; there were purple
smudges of exhaustion under her eyes.
My fault, he thought. He had walked into her life…hell, he
had bullied his way into her life, then dragged her halfway around
the world. Not that he owed her more delicate treatment. It was
just that she looked so innocent in her sleep. Her lustrous hair,
lying tumbled over one shoulder. Her translucent skin. Her lips,
delicately curved.
He could remember their taste.
96 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
Not from that last kiss he’d given her hours ago, a kiss given
in rage. He remembered her taste from that night in Ellos. How
her mouth had trembled beneath his. How her sigh of surrender
had mingled with his breath. How he had groaned at the sweetness
of her.
He didn’t think. Didn’t question. Instead, he bent down,
brushed a soft, silken curl from her cheek. Put his lips to her
temple. The pink shell of her ear. The curve of her jaw.
“Maria.” Her name was a whisper. “Maria,” he said again, and
when she sighed, he squatted beside her and pressed his lips
gently to hers.
Her lashes fluttered.
He kissed her again. Her taste was honeyed. Don’t, he
thought, don’t. But what could be wrong with one more kiss?
One more sip of nectar from her soft, rosy mouth? Just one last
brush of his lips against hers. Just one… And this time, her lips
parted to his. Clung lightly to his. Her eyes opened; her pupils
were huge and dark.
“Alexandros?” she whispered, and he was lost.
Groaning, he scooped her into his arms. Brought her down
on the soft Kilim carpet. Swept his hands into her hair, lifted her
lovely face to his, and took possession of her mouth.
“Alexandros,” she sighed.
His name. Not any other man’s. His. Only his, and now her
arms were around his neck, her mouth was moving on his as he
lay her back and came down beside her.
His hands cupped her face. Her beauty stole his breath; the
smile that trembled on her lips pierced his heart.
“Yes,” he said huskily. “That’s right, glyka mou. Saymyname.”
She did, again and again until he silenced her with a deep,
hungry kiss. A cry rose in her throat. Her arms tightened around
him. Her back arched; she rose against him and he groaned again
and slipped his hand inside her black tights.
Her flesh was warm. Soft. Fragrant with the glorious scent
of arousal.
He could feel the race of his blood.
SANDRA MARTON 97
He put his lips to her throat.
She sobbed his name. Cupped the back of his head. Urged his
mouth down, down, to the uptilted thrust of her breast. To the
pebbled nipple that pressed against the softness of her sweater.
He caught the bud lightly between his teeth. Her cry pierced the
thick silence.
“Yes,” she said, “yes, yes…”
He pushed up the sweater. Sucked a nipple into his mouth. She
was lifting herself to him, burying her fingers in his hair, urging
him closer, closer…
A knock, as strident as Olympian thunder, sounded at the
door. Alex barely heard it but Maria stiffened in his arms.
“Alex,” she hissed.
“Shh, agapi mou. Never mind.Whoever is there will go away.”
The knock came again. “Your Highness?” Athenia’s voice
was thin and apologetic. “Your mother is on the phone. She asks
if you and Keeria Santos would come by a few minutes early.”
Alex pressed his forehead to Maria’s. “Yes,” he called, “all
right. Tell the queen we’ll be there as soon as we can.” He waited
until he was sure the housekeeper was gone. Until he could move
without disgracing himself. Then he sat up. “We’ll finish this
later,” he started to say, but Maria had already rolled away from
him and risen to her feet. Her face was white except for two spots
of crimson high on her cheeks.
“Is that how you get your women, Your Highness? By taking
advantage of them when they’re asleep?”
Her voice shook with indignation. Hell, he was shaking, too,
but with thwarted desire.
“You know that isn’t how it was.”
“What I know,” she said, the words laced with accusation, “is
that I woke up and found you all over me!”
He stood and faced her, caught between equal parts of anger
and frustration.
“Liar,” he said in a low voice.
She turned her back. He grasped her shoulder and swung her
toward him.
98 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
“What’s the matter, glyka mou? Don’t you like it when the
tables are turned? When you’re not in control of the situation?”
“All right,” she snapped. “You made your point. You—you got
me to—to give in to you. Are you satisfied now?”
He gave a sharp, ugly laugh. “We have a long way to go until
I’m satisfied, sweetheart.”
The crimson drained from her face. “How can you do this?”
It was, he thought, an excellent question.
Despite everything, he was not a man who would ever take
an unwilling woman to bed. That was part of the problem, when
he came down to it. Maria said she didn’t want him but each time
he took her in his arms, she turned that into a lie. Or did she?
Was she still playing him? Was she using him now, even as
he was determined to use her? And how could he tell himself that
was what he was doing when the truth was he had never wanted
a woman as he wanted her and—be honest, Karedes—and
revenge or payback, whatever name he gave his supposed motivation,
had zero to do with what he felt once she was in his arms.
He turned away from her. Ran his hand through his thick, dark
hair.
He was a man who had always prided himself on logic. On
self-discipline. And right now, hell, who was he kidding? Ever
since the night he’d first met this woman, logic and self-discipline
had gone by the wayside.
Maybe it was enough to admit that he wanted her still, and
that at the end of a month she would be out of his system.
Damned right, she would, he thought grimly, and he turned and
faced her again.
“I suggest you return to the house,” he said brusquely. “One
of the maids has unpacked your suitcase. You have—” He
glanced at his watch. “You have twenty minutes to get ready and
then we leave for the palace.”
Her chin came up. “Where has your devoted slave put my
things?”
Thee mou, she enraged him! He wanted to shake her. Or strip
her naked and show her who was in charge here.
SANDRA MARTON 99
100 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
“Your clothes are where they belong,” he snapped. “In my
room. We have an agreement, Ms. Santos, that says you are to
fulfill your required duties in their entirety, or have you conveniently
forgotten that?”
She gave him a withering look. “How could I forget what is
sure to be the worst agreement of my life?”
It was, Maria thought, a fine line.
But the Prince of Arrogance only laughed, and that was the
sound that followed her all the way to the house.
CHAPTER EIGHT
WHAT did you wear to dine with royalty?
Probably nothing she’d packed, Maria thought unhappily as
she followed Athenia to Alex’s bedroom.
Bedroom? Could you call a room this size a bedroom? It was
bigger than her loft. Polished wood floors. Handmade rugs. A
cathedral ceiling. Skylights. A wall of glass and, beyond it, a
terrace and the pool that seemed to hang suspended over the bay.
And a bed.
A bed centered beneath the skylights, elevated on a raised
platform, covered by a black silk comforter and a sea of black
and white pillows as if it were a stage set.
“Madam will find her things hung in the dressing room.”
Maria swung toward Athenia. “Yes. I—I— Thank you.”
“Everything has been pressed, keeria, to your liking, I hope.”
“Thank you,” she said again. They seemed the only words she
could manage.
The housekeeper smiled politely and shut the door behind her.
Maria waited a couple of seconds, then turned the lock. She
leaned back against the door, shut her eyes and inhaled deeply.
It was a handsome room. Hell, it was a magnificent room.
And that bed…
Do not look at that bed, Maria. Do not even think about it.
She would not. She would shower and dress. She had twenty
minutes. Not much time, but enough. Actually, she never took
102 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
longer than that to get ready for a date. Except, thiswasn’t a date.
It was business. Business to be conducted at a palace.
She’d seen the palace—from the outside, anyway—the last
time she was here.
It made Buckingham Palace look small.
“That’s it,” she whispered.“Work yourself into a panic. That’s
going to be a huge help!” Spine straight, she ignored the bed and
marched across the room. This was an important night.
Indeed, it was. At the end of it, Alex was going to make love
to her.
Maria rolled her eyes. Itwas stupid to let her thoughtswander.
Of course, tonightwas important. She had the commission; now,
she had to make sure she had the hearts and minds of her clients.
Her clients. The king of Aristo and his queen. She’d come a
long way from the phony Frenchman of L’Orangerie.
The dressing room made her laugh. Add some plumbing and
most Manhattan residents would have happily called it an apartment.
And there were her things, on a rack all by themselves, surrounded
by other racks filled with men’s clothes. Alex’s clothes.
And no, she was not going to think about that now. Dinner
was everything. It had to go well.
Her clothes, as Athenia had told her, had been pressed, hung
and organized by color. Giddy laughter rose in her throat. Jeans
and jeans and jeans, T-shirts and blouses and sweaters. Organized
and pressed, and what in hell was there hanging in front of her
she could wear to a palace?
Casual, Alex had said. Easy for him to say. And to do.
What was he going to wear? And where would he shower and
dress?
Not here, and that was all that mattered. For all she knew, he
kept a complete wardrobe in each bedroom. A mistress in each,
too. Or maybe this was the way installing a new mistress was
handled. Maybe his staff was trained to move some of the
master’s clothes, just enough to get his latest conquest through
the confusion of her first night here.
Stop it, Maria thought furiously.
SANDRA MARTON 103
She was most assuredly not Alex’s conquest, she was his—
What would be the correct word? Never mind. She would not
dwell on how or why she was in his bedroom, or the implications
of it, either—or on the fact that his entire staff surely now
understood she would be sleeping with him.
A dozen other women probably had gone this route. She
lacked their experience in the art or business of being a kept
woman but instinct told her that a woman who filled that role
would not blush at such information being public.
She’d do her best not to blush, either.
Besides, Alex would not ‘keep’ her. The money for the commission
didn’t come from him. It was for the design and execution
of the queen’s birthday gift, and she would not accept so
much as a penny for anything else.
A phone rang.
Maria looked around. There it was. A small white telephone
on the wall of the dressing room. It rang again and she plucked
it from its cradle, put it to her ear and said a careful, “Hello?”
“You’re down to twelve minutes, glyka mou.”
“Alexandros?”
“I like it when you call me that.”
His voice was husky. Why did that roughness always send a
tingle along her skin?
“Alexandros!” She looked around wildly. “Where are you?”
He laughed. “Relax, sweetheart. I can’t see you—but I
know exactly what you’re doing.You’re standing in the middle
of my bedroom, trying not to look at the bed and wondering
what on earth possessed you to bring nothing suitable to wear
this evening.”
She blinked. “Wrong,” she said airily. After all, she was in the
dressing room, not the bedroom, and she’d already wasted time
trying not to look at the bed.
“Try the emerald silk dress and the black stiletto sandals.
And before you tell me you won’t wear another woman’s castoffs,
let me assure you they aren’t. The dress and shoes were
both delivered from the Chanel boutique in Ellos a couple of
hours before we arrived.” His words took on that same sexy
softness again. “I had to guess at the size, glyka mou, so I hope
I got them right. Of course, we won’t have any such difficulties
after tonight.”
Maria felt her entire body blush as she slammed the phone
back onto its cradle. How dared he buy her clothes? Did he really
think she’d wear anything he’d paid for?
There it was. The dress. And right below it, the shoes. Both
were gorgeous. The brilliant color of the dress would be perfect
with the delicately spiked heels. Exactly what she’d have bought
for an occasion like this…if she’d been in a position to spend,
what, ten thousand bucks?
She would not wear these things.
She would wear something of her own.
Black jeans. A white silk blouse. Dressy enough for dinner at
an upscale New York restaurant…but for dinner at a palace? For
what was, basically, a business meeting that was surely going to
change her life?
“Damn you, Alexandros,” she said bitterly—and knew she
had lost Round One.
She showered quickly, and never mind that the faint, clean scent
of the hand-milled soap reminded her of Alex. The shampoo had
the same effect. So what? Soap was soap, shampoo was
shampoo. She towel-dried her hair—no time for anything else—
and hurried into the dressing room.
There were more than shoes with the dress. There was a tiny
black evening purse. And undies.A black lace bra.A black lace
thong. The sheerest thigh-high nylons she’d ever seen.
She had her own underwear.
But not like this.
To hell with it.
She put on the bits of black lace, the sheer stockings. Hair loose
or up? Maria peered into the mirror. Up. The mass of dark strands
was too damp, too wild, too curly to leave loose. Finally, she
slipped on the emerald silk dress. Stepped into the black sandals.
104 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
And saw herself in the mirror.
He had good taste, the Prince of Arrogance, she thought wryly.
Acareer as a personal shopper could be his in the blink of an eye.
The dress was a perfect fit, demure and businesslike even as
it made the most of her slender figure. The shoes were gorgeous.
Straps that wound around her foot. Stiletto heels as thin as the
blade for which they were named.
Could he possibly know shoes were her weakness?
No, she thought. The better probability was that they were his
weakness. Maybe later tonight, he’d want her in the stilettos and
nothing besides the black lace thong…
“Oh God,” she whispered, and felt her heart rate shoot into
the stratosphere.
Jewelry, she thought numbly, because it was safer to think
about that than about what happened to her body each time she
imagined being in this room, in that bed, with the gorgeous
Alexandros. How could you hate a man and still want him?
A question for another time, not for the one minute—the one
minute she had left!
Fortunately, she’d dumped a couple of pieces of her stuff into
her handbag. A twisted gold chain? No. A shorter one, intricately
braided? No. A slender gold rope with a hunk of polished amber
knotted at the center? Yes. Perfect. Small gold hoops in her ears.
Had she forgotten anything? She certainly had. A quick swipe
of mascara. Sheer cherry lip gloss. A dab of powder on her
suddenly shiny nose.
She took a steadying breath. Another. Ready or not, she
thought, and she unlocked the bedroom door.
He was right outside it, waiting for her.
‘Gorgeous’was the wrong word to describe him. ‘Spectacular’
came closer, but it still didn’t quite cover it.
Say something, Maria told herself, but her brain was numb.
She could only look at him as he stood leaning back against the
cypress balustrade that enclosed the open loft, arms folded,
ankles crossed, the very portrait of The Male Waiting for his
Date. He wore a grey jacket, a black open-necked shirt, black
SANDRA MARTON 105
trousers and darkest brown mocs. His hair was damp; he was
freshly shaven…
He was beautiful. The in-the-flesh subject of a woman’s
dreams, except she didn’t have dreams like those. Well, not until
after that night they’d made love. Correction. That night they’d
had sex, and look where that had led.
He said nothing. Showed nothing. Slowly, slowly enough to
make her wonder if the dress didn’t look as good as she thought,
his gaze traveled from the top of her head all the way to her toes,
then back up again.
That was when he smiled. A slow, lazy, purely masculine
curve of his lips that sent shock waves through her blood.
“Just one thing…” He reached out, took the clip from her hair
and let all the wild curls tumble to her shoulders. “Perfect,” he
said softly.
She had to stop herself from returning the compliment.
Instead, she tossed her head as if it meant nothing. Damned if
that didn’t make him grin.
“Shall we?” he said, holding out his hand.
Maria ignored the offer, brushed past him and went down
the stairs.
His car was a low-slung, snarling crimson beast.
A Maserati. A Lamborghini. A Ferrari. One of those, she was
certain, but what would a born-and-bred New Yorker know?
Subway trains, yes. Automobiles, no. The only certainty was that
he drove fast, too fast, with a macho assurance that she tried not
to let impress her.
But it did.
Was there a female alive who wouldn’t be impressed by a man
so beautiful it hurt to look at him, driving a car that rumbled like
a big, predatory animal? One hand was curved over the steering
wheel. The other rested lightly on the gear shift lever.
Such competent hands. So powerful. His hands had been all
over her the night they’d met. She could still feel them, if she
closed her eyes. His fingertips playing with her nipples. His
106 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
thumbs gently parting her labia. Her shocked cries that had
quickly turned to sobs of ecstasy.
She felt the instant bloom of warmth between her thighs.
“Something the matter?”
His voice startled her. She looked at him and thought it was a
good thing he didn’t have X-ray vision or he’d see straight through
her clothes, see that she was wet, that her nipples were peaked.
“Maria?”
I want you, she thought dizzily, that’s what’s the matter.
“Are you worried about dinner tonight?”
No, she thought, on a faint wave of hysteria, not dinner.
“Don’t be. This is just my family.”
Dinner. She had to remember that. Hewas talking about dinner.
“Oh,” she said, and caught her bottom lip between her teeth.
Alex felt his muscles contract. Did she have to look so beautiful?
Did she have to worry her lip that way? Damn it, this was
not good. He should never have kissed her in the guesthouse.
He’d taken two cold showers before he got dressed and he was
still hard with wanting her.
What if he pulled the car over, took her in his arms and nipped
that sweet bottom lip himself? Just lightly enough to make her
moan and sigh and beg him…
“Family?” she said, and he blinked.
“Uh, yes. Family. My older brother, Sebastian. My baby
brother, Andreas. My sister Katarina—everyone calls her Kitty.
The only one missing will be Elissa. She’s in Paris.”
“So many people?”
The tip of her tongue slicked over that softly bitten, now undoubtedly
sensitive bottom lip. By the time they reached the
palace, he’d be completely out of his mind. When had this
woman assumed such power over him? It made him angry, and
his words were more harsh than he’d intended.
“Don’t tell me you’re nervous about meeting royalty, glyka
mou. After all, you did fine with me the first time out.”
She swung toward him.
“I told you, I didn’t know who you were.”
SANDRA MARTON 107
“Right. You just happened to meet me on the street and when
I suggested we go to bed, you said, hey, I have nothing else to
do, so why not?”
It hadn’t been like that and he knew it. She’d been sweetly
innocent; he’d seduced her with words, with caresses, with a need
unlike any he’d ever experienced in all his thirty-one years. Except,
it had all been a lie. She’d set him up. She had seduced him…
Hadn’t she?
“You know what, Alex?” she said, her voice shaking. “You’re
a real bastard!”
She was right. What was between them was personal and had
nothing to do with this evening’s gathering. Tonight was about
plans for the national celebration of his mother’s birthday. Affairs
of state came before everything else, a truth that had always
been part of his life.
“Okay. Let’s start over. Ask me again about who’ll be at
dinner tonight.”
Maria stared straight ahead. Alex sighed in resignation.
“You need to knowthese things, glyka mou. Howelse to prepare
for the sight of Sebastian, who stands four feet tall and weighs three
hundred pounds? Or to know that Andreas is in The Guinness
Book ofWorld Records forWorst Footballer of theYear?”
She swung toward him, as he’d hoped she would. “What?”
Alex grinned. “Don’t panic. We still tease Andreas over the
time he missed six consecutive tries in a game—but we leave out
the fact that he was only five years old at the time. As for
Sebastian…” His grin broadened. “The truth is, except for a lack
of hair anyplace but his knuckles and back, he’s not bad-looking.
Well, he’s not as handsome as I am, of course…”
He couldn’t be.
Alexwas joking, Maria knew. Still, what he’d said about being
handsome was true. He was, without question, the most beautiful
man she’d ever seen… And what did that have to do with
anything? He was still exactly what she’d called him. No-good,
self-centered and arrogant, and if she had not called him all those
names yet, she surely would before the evening ended.
108 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
She sat back, folded her hands in her lap and told herself she’d
get through whatever lay ahead because she had no other choice.
The Ferrari paused before the high gates outside the palace. A
smartly uniformed soldier stepped from the guardhouse, approached,
looked in at Alex, shot straight as a ramrod and delivered
a perfect salute.
“Your Highness.”
“Stavros. It’s good to see you pretending to be a soldier again.”
Maria looked at Alex in surprise. The soldier, still saluting, went
on staring directly ahead. “Especially since we both know I can
out-run, out-shoot, out-anything you choose when we have the
chance to give it another try.”
The soldier’s lips twitched. “Your Highness is, as usual, full
of, ah, full of air. Sir.”
Alex laughed and returned the salute. “At ease, Stavros. Good
to see you back. The ankle’s okay?”
The soldier grinned. “It’s fine, sir. And your shoulder?”
“Good to go. You signed up for the next Games?”
“Absolutely, sir. And you?”
“Try and keep me away,” Alex said, smiling.
Another smart salute; the gates opened and they drove slowly
down a wide, tree-lined avenue toward the broad marble steps
that led to the front doors of the palace.
“You and that man know each other?” Maria said.
“For years. We went to nursery school together.” He smiled.
“My mother’s modernist ideas won out that time. My father
thought it was a mistake to educate me among what he tried not
to call the commoners.”
“But he didn’t—I mean, the way he addressed you—”
“What’s the problem, sweetheart? Disappointed to find out
some people don’t think of me as you do?”
He pulled up before the steps. A valet opened his door; another
did the same for Maria. Ahead, the enormous entry doors swung
open. To Maria’s surprise, she saw the world-famous King
Aegeus and Queen Tia in the doorway.
SANDRA MARTON 109
“They asked me to bring you in through the Grand Hall,”Alex
said softly as he moved around the car to stand beside her. “And
they’re greeting you themselves. We are not as formal as some
royal houses but still, this is an honor.” He offered her his arm.
“Take it,” he said softly, “and smile, or my parents will think you
hate me.And you don’t hate me, glyka mou.We both knowthat.”
“Wrong,” Maria said sweetly. “But why should I take it out
on them?”
She put her hand lightly on his arm, took a deep breath, and
let him lead her up the steps.
“…and so,” Princess Kitty said, “Alex convinced me that it was
my royal obligation to sneak into the butler’s pantry to find out
what our parents had bought us for Christmas—well, it wasn’t a
butler’s pantry anymore, of course, it was just this huge room we
store stuff in at the beach house at Kionia—has Alex told you
about Kionia? Oh, it’s this incredible stretch of land overlooking
the Strait of Poseidon that separates us from Calista, and our
house is big and old and beautiful, and it’s all very laid-back, you
know, I can go around dressed casually—”
“Sloppily, you mean,” Aegeus said, his tone harsh. “And
why are we boring our guest with talk of childish pranks done
years ago?”
The family dining room became silent. Kitty’s round, pretty
face turned crimson. “Of course. Ms. Santos, my apologies.”
“Oh, please, don’t apologize.” Without thinking, Maria
reached for the princess’s hand. “It’s lovely to hear stories like
that. My own childhood wasn’t as much fun. No brothers. No
sisters.” Suddenly, she realized that every eye was on her, and
that she was hanging onto Kitty’s hand as if it belonged to Sela
and not a princess. Flushed, she let go. “I mean—I mean, this
has been such a lovely evening…You’ve all been so—so—”
“It’s been our pleasure, Ms. Santos,” the queen said gently.
“Please, won’t you all call me Maria?”
“Maria.” Tia smiled. “I hope you intend to see some of our
island in the next few weeks.”
110 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
Maria shot a glance at Alex, who was calmly drinking his
coffee. “If I have the chance.”
“I’m fascinated by the thought of such a slip of a girl designing
and making such a magnificent necklace. I understand
Alex has outfitted a workshop for you in his home on
the coast.”
“Yes.” This time, Maria didn’t dare look at Alex. “He has.”
“And is it to your liking?”
What was the sense in lying? “Very much so, Your Majesty.
In fact, it’s better equipped than my own place in New York.”
“Good. If you should need anything more—”
“Well, I do need something. A couple of things, actually…”
“Such as?”
“Some information, to start. I understand that King Christos
ordered the Stefani diamond, which had been the centerpiece of
the crown of Adamas, to be split in two.”
She could almost feel the sudden tension in the room.
“I fail to see why the history of Adamas should be under discussion,”
the king said stiffly.
Maria cleared her throat. “I don’t mean to pry, Your Majesty.
It’s only that knowing the history of the diamond will help me
in creating the necklace.”
“Nonsense. Gold and diamonds well help, not timeworn stories
about the Stefani diamond and the islands of Aristo and Calista.”
Silence. Then Maria felt Alex clasp her hand under cover of
the table and enfold it in his own.
“Maria is an artist, Father. Her creations are, in a sense, representations
of a life force—in this case, a celebration of
Mother’s birthday as well as the continuity of our people. She’s
simply trying to gain some understanding of our kingdom. Isn’t
that right, Maria?”
“Yes,” she said, staring at Alex, amazed he should instinctively
comprehend what most people did not. “Stories,
legends, history…those are some of the qualities my work is
meant to convey.”
“Well, our history isn’t very complicated,” Sebastian said
SANDRA MARTON 111
pleasantly. “The Kingdom of Adamas dates back to ancient
Rome and Greece.”
“Yes,” Maria said again. “Alex told me it did.”
“Aristo was the island from which the kingdom was ruled. It
grew wealthy on its trade routes with Greece, Turkey and Egypt,”
Andreas said. “Calista had—has—its diamond mines. Pink
diamonds. Very rare—but, of course, you know that.”
Alex squeezed her hand in reassurance.
“The Karedes family—our family—got fat and rich trading
those diamonds to Europe.” He smiled wryly. “As you can probably
imagine, the Calistans didn’t like that. My grandfather—”
“King Christos,” Maria said.
“Yes. He tried to alleviate the tension but it didn’t work, so
he announced that on his death, he’d leave Aristo to be ruled by
my father and Calista to be ruled by my father’s sister, Anya.”
“And the people accepted that?”
“What else could they do?” Sebastian said. “But Christos
always hoped for a reconciliation. Part of what he said, when he
made his decision public, was that he wished the two halves of
the Stefani diamond would someday be reunited and that when
they were, the island would also be reunited as one nation, the
nation of Adamas. We call it Christos’s Legacy.”
Kitty nodded. “But it hasn’t happened.”
“That must have been a difficult time for everyone.” Maria
looked at the king. “For you and your sister, especially, sir.”
“It’s all in the past,” Aegeus snapped. “And I fail to see a need
to go through it with a stranger.” He tossed his napkin on the
table. “You are to make a necklace for the queen, Ms. Santos,
not write our family’s history.”
“Just a minute,” Alex began, but Maria spoke first.
“My sole interest is in making the necklace as meaningful and
perfect a gift as possible, sir.” She sounded composed but Alex
recognized that distinct, don’t-screw-with-me lift of her chin. “I
regret that you don’t see it that way.”
Alex bit back a grin. His Maria had been nervous about dining
with royalty, but she sure as hell had the balls to stand up to
112 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
Aegeus. His brothers were trying not to smile; his sister looked
as if she might fly from her seat, grab Maria and kiss her. The
queen gave a soft cough and covered her mouth with her napkin.
Aegeus looked as if he weren’t sure if he’d been insulted or
not. Finally he nodded, shoved back his chair and got to his feet.
The meal was over.
“Perhaps I overreacted, Ms. Santos. At any rate, a perfect gift
is my wish, too. And now, if you require nothing further—”
“Actually,” Maria said carefully, “actually, sir, I do.”
Aegeus stared at her. So did the others.You could push the king
just so far and then you had to stand back before the explosion.
“Do you, indeed?” he said coldly.
Maria looked determined but she was shaking. Enough, Alex
decided, and, despite all the eyes on her, he moved closer and
slipped his arm around her shoulders. At first, she stiffened.
Then he felt her lean into him.
“It’s—it’s a request, sir.” She took a deep breath. “I’d like to
see the Aristan crown.”
“You have seen it,” the king said coolly. “My people provided
you with photographs.”
“Photos aren’t the same as the real thing, Your Majesty.”
“Impossible. For security purposes, the crown is kept in the
royal vaults.”
“Surely, it can be taken out of the vaults, Father,” Alex said
quietly.
“There is no need.”
“Oh, but there is, sir,” Maria said quickly. “I need to be certain
the center diamond in the necklace, the big pink one, will be the
correct shade. A diamond’s true color can never be conveyed
through a photo, no matter how good the photo is.”
“You mentioned color in your proposal. That is the reason I
provided you with two large pink stones rather than one.” The
king’s lips twisted. “Surely you noticed that.”
“Of course, Your Majesty. And I very much appreciate that
thoughtful gesture.”
“Thoughtful, and expensive, Ms. Santos.”
SANDRA MARTON 113
“It was a generous thing to do, sir.” Maria drew a breath. “But
there are slight variations in the colors of the two pink diamonds.
That’s all the more reason for seeing the crown.”
“I refer you, again, to the photographs. I have been assured
that digital photos are quite accurate.”
“Not when it comes to color,” Maria said with quiet determination.
“Plus, I need to see, to touch the Aristan half of the
Stefani diamond.” She flushed. “Stones have a way of
speaking to those who work with them, sir. I know it may
sound strange—”
“Strange?” Aegeus snorted. “It would seem I was correct in
fearing this young woman might be a leftover flower child,” he
said to no one in particular, “instead of a jewelry maker.”
“Actually, Father,” Alex said coldly, “Maria is neither.” He
felt her body jerk against his. Deliberately, he drew her closer.
“She is an artist, and we are very fortunate she agreed to
create this piece.” His eyes met Aegeus’s. “I think you owe her
an apology.”
The king’s face turned red. No one spoke for what seemed an
eternity. Then the queen cleared her throat, stood and took her
husband’s arm.
“Aegeus, Alexandros. Please, let’s not spoil the wonderful
plans for my birthday celebration. I am so excited about this
necklace… Just think, Aegeus, the entire world will be watching
when you present it to me. The necklace should, indeed, be as
perfect as Ms. Santos can make it, should it not? It should glow
with the same light as the Aristan crown, especially since you’ll
be wearing the crown that night.”
Silence. A muscle knotted in Alex’s jaw. Then he nodded.
“Mother is right, Father. I’m sorry if I seemed rude, but I
spoke the truth. Maria’s talent will ensure that people everywhere
will talk of Aristo, its crown and the queen’s matching
necklace for years to come.”
The king stood as still as a statue. Then, at last, he jerked his
head in assent.
“I’ll make the arrangements. Ms. Santos, you shall have five
114 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
minutes with the crown and the Stefani diamond. Five minutes,
and not a second more. Is that clear?”
Maria stepped free of Alex’s encircling arm and made a
deep curtsy.
“It is, sir. And thank you. You won’t regret your decision.”
Aegeus looked at her.A shadow seemed to pass over his face.
“I hope not,” he said, and strode away.
They drove back to the mansion in silence.
The gates swung open; the Ferrari purred down the long drive.
When they reached the house, Alex turned off the engine, stepped
from the car, opened Maria’s door and thought what an amazing
woman she was.
Bright. Talented. Strong.
And lovely.
Incredibly lovely, in the moonlight.
She would be even more lovely in his bed.
Naked. Her eyes on his as he undressed. Her arms reaching
for him as he came to her and she would reach for him, he
would find a way to make her admit how much she wanted
him—and yet, at this moment, what he wanted most was to kiss
away the worried furrow between her eyes, the sad little downcurve
of her mouth.
He held out his hand. “We’re home,” he said softly.
She nodded, took his hand and stepped from the car.
“Your father will probably sendmeback to the States tomorrow.”
Alex smiled. “No danger of that,” he said as they walked to
the door. “He’s trapped. My mother, clever woman that she is,
reminded him that the world will be watching when she celebrates
her birthday.”
“Don’t try and make it sound as if I didn’t behave foolishly!”
“The word I’d use is ‘bravely.’”
“I don’t know what got into me. It’s just—”
“What got into you,” he said, turning her to him, “was all that
fiery passion you do your best to hide.”
“I don’t hide anything. I just—”
SANDRA MARTON 115
“And you do a pretty good job of it—until something comes
along and heats your blood.” He opened the door to the
sleeping house, then turned toward her again and caught a
cluster of silky curls in his fingers. “Tonight, it was the ridiculous
behavior of a king.”
“No. I mean, I only—”
“And your dedication to your art.”
“That’s—that’s nice of you to say, but I made everyone uncomfortable——”
“And me.” His voice roughened. He cupped the nape of her
neck, slipped his fingers into her hair and tilted her face to his.
“I heat your blood, agapimeni. As you heat mine.”
He bent his head and kissed her. It was a gentle kiss, the soft
whisper of his lips over hers, but it made him groan.
“Maria,” he said softly, and he felt her tremble. “Maria,” he
said again, and her arms rose, wound around his neck; she lifted
herself to him, sighed his name and when he kissed her again he
went deep. Deeper, letting the taste of her fill his senses, the feel
of her feed his soul…
And he knew, without question, that he could not, would not
hold her to the devil’s bargain they’d made.
Gently, he cupped her face and drew back. Her eyes opened
slowly; she looked up at him, her pupils dark and wide and
blurred with desire or perhaps with tears. It killed him that he
couldn’t tell the difference.
“It’s late,” he said. “Too late to discuss this tonight.” His gaze
fell to her lips. He longed to kiss her again but he wouldn’t. He
wouldn’t. He wouldn’t. “Can you find your way to your
bedroom alone?”
“But I thought— You said—”
“I know what I said.” He drew a ragged breath and then, to
hell with it, he kissed her. “I’m not a saint, Maria,” he whispered
against her mouth, “but it turns out that I’m not quite the bastard
we both thought.”
A sound that might have been a sob broke from her throat. “I
don’t understand, Alexandros. What is it you want from me?”
116 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
He shook his head, left her standing alone as he headed out
into the night.
He didn’t know what he wanted from her.
And that was the whole damned problem.
SANDRA MARTON 117
CHAPTER NINE
WHAT did a man do when he was obviously losing his sanity?
It had to be that because he sure as hell wasn’t into martyrdom,
Alex thought as he paced through the dark garden. Maybe
he deserved a medal. Better still, maybe he should get his head
checked by a shrink because right now, right now, instead of
burning with frustration, he could be bedding the woman he’d
brought across an ocean for expressly that purpose.
Maria had been his. His for the taking.
And he’d walked away.
“Idiot,” he said, kicking a stone out of the path.
Walked away, and for what reason? She’d been as ready for
sex as he was. She wasn’t an innocent. Nothing he’d have done
would have shocked her.
Alex glared at the house where a light still burned in his
bedroom window. He could be in the house, in that room in less
than a minute.
Forget it.
He’d made his decision. For tonight, anyway. Going back
would be an admission of weakness, never mind that he didn’t
really know what in hell he meant by that, except that he knew
it would be.
He needed sex, not Maria. That put things in perspective.
He was aroused. No problem. There were ways to deal with
it. Phone one of the numbers programmed into his cell phone.
SANDRA MARTON 119
There were half a dozen beautiful women who’d jump at the
chance to spend the night with him. Or he could drive back into
town. The bar at The Grand Hotel saw more than its share of
gorgeous women, tourists hoping for a little adventure.
Except, he didn’t want another woman, and wasn’t that a
laugh? He wanted Maria and he’d just walked away from her.
Alex kicked another stone and headed for his Ferrari.
He roared out of the gates, took the coast road at a speed that
sent him flying past the few startled drivers on the road at this
late hour. When he reached the point at which the already
narrow, winding road grew more treacherous, he floored the gas
pedal and the car careered through the turns like the thoroughbred
it was.
Maybe that would burn away the hunger thrumming
through his blood.
It didn’t.
Two hours later, he pulled through the gates of the mansion
again and skidded to a stop with Maria still in his head.
Images. Memories. Tastes and scents, all of them conspiring
against him. The softness of her skin. The honey of her mouth.
The texture of her uptilted nipples on his tongue. The scent of
her desire.
She was there, in his brain, and nothing could dislodge her.
Well, yeah. One thing could.
His body hardened like a fist.
Having her would do it. Stripping off her clothes. Baring her
body to his eyes. To his hands. His mouth. Clasping her wrists,
holding them high over her head so she had no choice but to let
him touch her everywhere until she wept with wanting him.
Then he’d sink into her. Deep, deep into her. He’d move
inside her until she screamed his name, until she came and
came and came…
A growl of anger, of desire, of something close to lunacy rose
in his throat. He crossed his hands on the steering wheel and
slammed his forehead against them. After a few minutes, he
stepped from the car and entered the house.
It was quiet. Dark. The furniture cast ominous black shadows
against the walls.
Alex’s mouth thinned as he stood in the entry foyer and stared
up at the second floor landing.
He was no knight in shining armor. He was a man who had
grown up in a world of privilege, a man who could have what he
wanted when he wanted it. Especially women. The more beautiful
they were, the more famous, the more they threw themselves
at his feet. They begged for his possession. Preened to ready
themselves for his taking, not like Maria who asked nothing of
him and had packed a suitcase full of jeans to wear in her role
as his mistress.
She looked beautiful in jeans.
And in that dress tonight, those sexy shoes, stuff he’d ordered
over the phone just figuring anything the color of emeralds would
be perfect against her dark hair and eyes…
When she’d opened that door, when he saw her… God, he’d
wanted to push her back inside the room, tumble her on the bed,
make love to her until she had no choice but to admit she’d
dreamed of this, ached for this, that she wanted him, only him…
He swung away from the staircase, marched through the silent
house to his study, poured himself a shot of brandy, slugged it
down and did what he’d been doing hours ago in the garden,
paced and paced and paced.
A sto diavolo! The hell with it! He was weary of the game. It
was time to end it.
He took the stairs two at a time, went down the hall, stopped
before the door to his bedroom, raised his fist to knock… Knock?
At his own damned door? Bad enough he’d showered and
dressed in his study, that he’d spent the last couple of hours
driving aimlessly through the night. He cursed, ripely and creatively,
grabbed the knob and turned it, ready to break the damned
door down if he had to.
It opened easily.
Maria wasn’t there. The emerald dress was crumpled on a
chair, the black stilettos were on the floor next to it.
120 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
The bed was untouched.
His anger vanished. Fear took its place.Wherewas she? Had she
left? Not likely. She’d have had to phone for a taxi, and a cabwould
not have been able to clear the gates without alerting Security.
What, then? Had she gone for a walk ? Alex’s mouth tightened.
She wouldn’t have done that, would she? Not at night. Not
when she didn’t know the complex layout of the gardens, the
density of the surrounding trees.
The way some of the pathways ended at vistas at the very edge
of the cliff.
No, he thought, forcing aside the ugly possibility. If she were
wandering the grounds, motion detectors would have picked her
up. Then where…?
The guesthouse!
Alex pounded down the stairs and out the door, walking fast,
running, really, his anger back and hotter than ever. Did she
think she could escape him? That he’d let her sleep there rather
than in his bed, where she belonged? Yes. There was a faint light
shining in the guesthouse window.
“Damn it, Maria,” he growled as he flung open the door, “if
you think I’m going to go on being a Boy Scout…”
The furious words died on his tongue.
She was huddled in a window seat, illuminated by the flickering
glow of candlelight. She wore jeans and an oversized
sweatshirt, her feet were tucked up under her and when she heard
his voice, she swung toward him, face pale, eyes huge and
stricken and glittering with tears.
“I’m sorry,” she said in a broken whisper. “I’m sorry for everything,
Alexandros. I should never have come here. I know
what I agreed to but I can’t do it, I can’t, I can’t.”
By then, he’d crossed the space between them and gathered
her into his arms.
“Don’t,” she said.
He ignored the plea, whispered to her in Greek the way he
might have whispered to a terrified child. He stroked her hair,
rocked her against him and she began to sob.
SANDRA MARTON 121
“I know I agreed to—to be your mistress, but I can’t do it.
Even if it means losing the commission. I can’t. I can’t. I really
thought I could but—”
“No. Of course, you can’t.” He drew her into his lap. “Shh,
glyka mou. I won’t hurt you. I could never hurt you. Please,
don’t cry.”
“I didn’t know who you were that night, Alexandros. I swear
it. I went with you because—because…I can’t explain it. I’d
never done anything like that before. I’d never even—I’d never
even—” She drew a ragged breath. “I know you won’t believe
me but—but I’d never been with a man before.”
Ah, dear Lord!
The sweet, sad little confession made him feel like a bastard—
and filled him with joy. He did believe her; the truth was, he’d
known it, deep within himself, all along. His beautiful Maria had
given him her innocence. Hell, he had taken it from her. And, of
course, she had not known who he was.
She was incapable of that kind of subterfuge.
Why hadn’t he believed her? How could he have been so
stupid? How could he have judged her by what he knew of other
women, the ones who’d tried to trap him with their lies? There
had been so many of them, starting with the Greek girl who’d
broken his heart when they’d both been kids. He’d been sure he
loved her and when she wept and trembled and told him he’d
stolen her virginity, he’d been ready to marry her—until he’d
caught her laughing with her friends at his gullibility. The Italian
debutante who said she’d die in sin if he didn’t take her as his
wife, except it turned out she’d already slept with half the young
princes in Europe. The German supermodel who’d accused him
of making her pregnant. Wiser than in the past, he’d demanded
a paternity test—and had not heard from her again.
But Maria was nothing like that. She was—she was Maria,
sweet and smart and brave, and he’d put her through hell.
“I’ll recommend someone good, someone excellent to take
my place making the necklace,” she said in a low voice . “You
can let him use my design—I owe your mother that—but—”
122 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
Alex stopped the flow of words with a soft kiss.
“You owe no one anything, glyka mou. And why would I let
someone take your place?” Smiling, he thumbed a strand of
dark hair from her brow. “There is no one who could replace you,
sweetheart. Like your design, you are one of a kind.”
“But I just told you, I can’t—”
“Maria.” He framed her face with his hands. “I’m setting you
free of our agreement. You’ll stay here, create a necklace the
entire world will admire—but not because we’ve made love.” He
took a deep breath. “I want you, kardia mou. I want you so much
it hurts. But I would never take something you would not willingly
give.” His mouth twisted. “I did that to you once, and I will
never forgive myself for—”
She put her fingers lightly over his mouth.
“I gave myself to you that night, Alex. I wanted you.” She
swallowed, ran the tip of her tongue over her bottom lip. “I
want you now.”
Could a woman’s soft words make the universe tilt? “Sweetheart.
Do you know what you’re saying?”
She gave a watery little laugh. “I know exactly what I’m
saying. That’s why I can’t stay here. I want you, despite what you
think of me, and isn’t that terrible? To admit something that—
that strips me of what little pride I have left—”
He kissed her. “Hush,” he whispered.
“It’s the truth. If I had any pride, I wouldn’t have come to
Aristo with you. I wouldn’t have said I’d sleep with you.
Because—because it wasn’t only the commission, Alex, it was
being with you…”
He kissed her again. He meant the kiss to be gentle and that
was how it began but somehow her lips parted under his. The tip
of her tongue slipped into his mouth. And when she wound her
arms around his neck and dragged his face down to hers, he
reached blindly for one final bit of sanity.
“Maria,” he said against her mouth, “sweetheart, be sure. Be
very sure—”
“I’ve never been more sure of anything in my life.”
SANDRA MARTON 123
Alex groaned, swept her into his arms and carried her through
the moonlight to the bed.
This bed was not like his.
It was smaller. Simpler. It had been made from a centuriesold
olive tree and was covered in white cotton loomed in a nearby
village. It had an intrinsic, natural beauty all its own.
It was, Alex thought as he lay Maria across it, beautiful in the
same way as she, with a quiet strength and an elegance that came
from within.
“Alexandros,” she sighed, and raised her arms to him.
He went into her embrace and kissed her.
Two months ago, a lifetime ago, they had made love fiercely.
He had all but torn off her clothes in his frenzy to bury himself
inside her.
That had been sex.
Now…now, it was something more.
He kissed her again and again, until her lips were as soft as
rose petals and clung hungrily to his. He framed her face,
threaded his fingers into her hair, kissed her throat, nipped at the
tender flesh at the juncture of neck and shoulder and when she
moaned with pleasure, he could have sworn he felt his heart lift
in his chest.
Slowly, he sat her up. Drew her sweatshirt over her head and
discovered, to his delight, that she wore nothing beneath it or the
jeans that he tossed aside.
Naked, she was a moon-kissed offering to the gods.
Beautiful. Perfect. Exquisitely feminine.
Slowly, so slowly, his eyes on hers, he stroked the contours
of her body. Her breasts. Her belly. Her thighs. She sighed and
moaned and made the kinds of little sounds that told him, as much
as the sensual lift of her hips, that what hewas doing pleased her.
Still, he had to ask.
“Do you like this?” he whispered, sucking a beaded nipple
deep into the heat of his mouth. “This?” he said, kissing his way
from breast to belly. “This?” he said softly, dropping a kiss on
the soft curls at the juncture of her thighs.
124 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
“Alexandros,” she said, “oh God, Alexandros…”
Gently, he parted her thighs. Put his hands under her bottom.
Lifted her to him, put his mouth to the delicate cleft of her flesh,
found her with his mouth, his tongue, and her scream of joy shattered
the night.
It was almost too much for him.
He was so close to the edge. All these weeks of wanting her.
And, though it seemed crazy, all the years ofwanting her, as well.
“Alexandros,” she whispered, and he kissed her mouth, her
throat and knew that he, like Paris when he stole Helen centuries
before, had not been able to obey the rules of the civilized
world. This was what he had wanted, this woman, this lover, and
he had done whatever it took to have her.
He would have given everything for this, the honeyed taste of
her mouth. This, the sweetness of her nipples. This, the indentation
of her navel. This, the curve of her hips.
This, he thought, just this, holding her, tasting her, watching
her face as he caressed her. As he again parted the delicate petals
that protected her clitoris.
He kissed her there again. Licked her until she came again.
This time, when she cried out, she reached for him.
“Please, Alexandros,” she said, “please. Come into me.”
Quickly, he tore off his clothes. Came back to her, swore,
reached for his discarded jacket, dug into the inside pocket and
prayed he’d find a condom. He did, and he tore the little packet
open, rolled the condom on. He’d forgotten to use one the first time
he’d made love to her; he’d been too hungry, too out of control.
He was almost out of control now. That was what happened
to him, when he was with her.
He moved up her body, took her in his arms, kissed her, let
her taste the proof of their passion in his kiss. Her hands were
on him now, cool against his skin. She stroked her palms along
his shoulders, his chest, down his belly and when one hand
moved lower and almost closed around his hard length, his breath
hissed between his teeth.
“Maria,” he said in a warning whisper. “Maria, glyka mou…”
SANDRA MARTON 125
126 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
She caressed him anyway, her hand moving, moving up and
down over his swollen sex, and he groaned, caught her hand and
stilled it and knew he could wait no longer.
“Look at me, agapi mou.Watch me as I make you mine.”
Her lashes lifted. Her eyes met his. He clasped both her hands.
Laced their fingers together. Held their hands to the sides and
thrust into her.
She came instantly, her body arching to his, her cries of
abandon rising into the night and still he eased forward. Deeper.
Deeper until there was no way to know where he began and she
ended, until their flesh, their souls, were one.
“Maria,” he said, “Maria, kardia mou, agapi mou…”
She wept and kissed his mouth, and as the muscles of her
womb contracted rhythmically around him, Alexandros threw
back his head and emptied himself into the sweet warmth of the
woman who now belonged to him.
To me, he thought fiercely. Only to me.
CHAPTER TEN
FOR a long moment, the world stood still.
Alex’s powerful body was sprawled over Maria’s, his face
buried in her throat, their hearts still racing, skin damp with the
commingled sweat of their passion. The night breeze, drifting
across them from the still-open door, was chill. But when Alex
began to ease away, Maria tightened her arms around him.
“Don’t go,” she murmured, and felt his lips curve in a smile.
“I’m not going very far.”
He reached for the throw at the foot of the bed, wrapped it
around them, rolled to his side and gathered her close in his arms.
“Are you all right?”
It was her turn to smile. “Yes.”
“You sure?””
“Very sure. I’m fine. I’m perfect. I’m—”
“Yes,” he said, laughing softly as he kissed her, “you are.”
Tenderly, he brushed back the tangled curls on her forehead.
“Forgive me, agapi mou.”
“For what?”
“For not making love to you this way the first time.”
She shook her head, lay her hand against his cheek. “That first
time was wonderful.”
A very male smile lit his face. “Thank you. But you were a
virgin. I should have gone slower.”
“You didn’t know.”
128 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
“I should have.” He turned his face into her hand and kissed
the palm. “There was such a sweetness to you, glyka mou. Such
an innocence. The way you touched me. Responded to me.” His
hand slipped down her body, cupping her breast, then the curve
of her hip. “I’ve relived those moments a hundred times,” he said
huskily. “The feel of you.Your little cries. The way you blushed
when I undressed you.” His mouth twisted. “The way I ruined it
all with my terrible accusations.”
Maria put a finger over his lips. “Didn’t some wise man once
say that the past is best left in the past?”
Alex drew her fingertip into the heat of his mouth. “Do you
forgive me?”
“Forgive you for what?” she said, with a little smile. “I don’t
know what you’re talking about, Alexandros.”
His eyes darkened. “I love how you say my name.”
“Alexandros,” she sighed, “Alexandros, Alexandros,
Alexandros…”
Just that—the sound of her voice, the feel of her against him—
and he felt himself turning hard. “Maria,” he said, “my Maria,”
and then he was inside her again, deep inside her, and the night
enfolded them in its magical embrace.
Just before sunrise, when the grass glittered with dew, they
dressed and made their way to the house.
“Someone will see us,” Maria hissed as Alex drew her inside.
“Who could possibly see us?”
“Spoken like a true potentate,” she said, laughing up at him.
“What aboutAthenia? The cook? The maids? The rest of the staff?”
Alex swung her into his arms and carried her to his room.
“The souls of discretion, I promise.”
Well, of course. They would be. Maria’s smile dimmed just
a little. No point in being foolish about this. Other women would
have slept in Alex’s bed…
“No.”
She looked up. Alex was watching her and smiling.
“No, what?”
SANDRA MARTON 129
“No other women, sweetheart. Not here.” He could see that
she was surprised. And pleased. Crazy as it seemed, so was he.
He set her on her feet, gently pushed her back against the
closed bedroom door and framed her face with his hands. “Just
you. Which means,” he said solemnly, but with a glint of
laughter in his eyes, “we’re going to have to celebrate the
occasion. Initiate my bed properly.” He bent his head, brushed
her lips with his. “Champagne. Candles. Rose petals. How
does that sound?”
Could he feel her heart racing? Could he possibly know what
was in that racing heart, the emotions that she had spent the past
two months, the past two days trying her best to deny?
“It sounds wonderful.” She moved, just a little, enough so she
was pressed against him. “But won’t it take an awfully long time
to get all those things together?”
She saw the change sweep through him. The narrowed mouth.
The tic of a muscle in his jaw. The hint of exciting male passion
that seemed to make the beautiful structure of his face even more
pronounced.
“Maria,” he said thickly, “Dear God, Maria…”
They didn’t make it to the bed. Not then. But they did the next
time, and the next, where they made love until the Aristan sun
blazed bright and hot in the perfect blue of the sky.
When he awoke, the space beside him was empty. He sat up, the
covers falling to his waist.
“Maria?” Naked, he padded to the bathroom. The door was
locked; he heard the sound of running water and then nothing.
“Maria?” he said again, and knocked.
“I’m fine,” she called, but the weak sound of her voice was
evidence of the lie. His heart turned over. She’d been sick before,
sick again, and now… “Maria? Open the door. Please.”
There was a silence. Then he heard the lock turn. The door
swung open and he saw his Maria, standing at the sink with a
toothbrush in her hand, looking at him in the mirror. She smiled,
but her face was pale and sweaty.
“Kardia mou,” Alex said urgently, stepping behind her and
encircling her with his arms, “were you ill again?”
She nodded. “A little.”
“Maria, this has happened too often.”
“It’s just flu, Alexandros,” she said, forcing another smile.
“New York’s loaded with it.”
“This is not flu. I had flu last winter. Andreas had it, too. With
flu you’re sick and then you get better. But you—you’re not
getting better.”
“I am. Much better.”
“I will take you to my doctor.”
“Don’t be silly.”
“He will examine you, glyka mou, and prescribe an antibiotic.”
“Antibiotics don’t work against viruses, and flu is a virus.”
“Such logic,” Alex said, trying to sound angry when what he
felt was fear. She was so pale, her eyes so dark… “Come here,”
he said, and turned her and drew her close. “I don’t want you to
be sick, sweetheart. Let me take care of you.”
“I’m fine. Honestly.”
“Thee mou, you’re a stubborn woman! Very well. No doctor.”
He swung her up in his arms. “At least, come back to bed and
rest for a little while.”
He carried her to the bed and lay down with her in his arms.
Kissed her tenderly. Stroked her back. And, inevitably, as he held
her, as his body heated hers, as she burrowed against him, tenderness
gave way to desire.
“Are you sure you’re okay?” he whispered as he touched her.
“Shall I stop?”
“Don’t stop,” she whispered back, “don’t ever stop.”
And he didn’t.
She was gone again, the next time he awoke.
A knot of apprehension formed in his belly but the bathroom
door stood open and the room was empty.
He showered quickly, pulled on jeans, a white T-shirt and
mocs, and went downstairs. He could hear the radio playing
130 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
softly in the kitchen, turned to Athenia’s favorite music station.
She smiled at him.
“Kalimera, sir.”
“Have you seen Miss Santos?”
“Oh, yes, perhaps an hour ago. She had coffee and—”
“She was all right?”
His housekeeper raised her eyebrows. “Fine, sir. She went to
the guesthouse. To her workshop, I mean.”
The workshop. Alex ran a hand through his hair. “Of course,”
he said sheepishly.
He found her there, perched on a high stool at a workbench.
She was wearing jeans and a blue chambray shirt with the
sleeves rolled up. She’d pulled her hair back in a ponytail; her
feet were bare, one on the rung of the stool, one on the floor.
She was bent over a sketchpad, intensity in every line of her
body, and humming something he couldn’t identify other than
to be sure the tune was almost painfully off-key.
He smiled, came up behind her quietly and slipped his arms
around her.
“Kalimera, kardoula mou,” he said softly, and kissed the nape
of her neck.
She sank back against him, her head against his shoulder, her
hands covering his.
“Kalimera, Alexandros,” she said, and turned her face to his
for a kiss.
“Mmm,” he said. She tasted wonderful, of coffee and of
herself. “I missed you.”
She laughed. “I’m glad to hear it.”
Alex grinned and turned her in his arms. “Then, why were you
in such a hurry to leave my bed?”
“Oh, I wasn’t in a hurry at all!” She blushed. “I mean—”
“Such a nice compliment, glyka mou. No need to explain it
away.”
Maria linked her hands behind his neck. “I woke up and
thought of a small change I want to make in your mother’s
necklace. Nothing that will alter the design,” she said hastily,
SANDRA MARTON 131
“just a modification in the way I planned to position the central
stone. I promise, she’ll still like it.”
“She’ll love it, Maria. She thinks the design, your work, all
the pictures you sent, are brilliant.”
Her face glowed with pleasure. “I’m so glad, Alexandros! This
commission means the world to me.”
His gaze fell to her lips. “What else means the world to you?”
he said huskily.
His hands slid under her shirt, cupped her breasts. Her
breath caught; he watched her eyes turn from hazel to coffeebrown
to ink-black.
“This,” she said, covering his hands with hers, “oh, this,
this, this…”
He carried her to the bed. And as he came down beside her
and kissed her, as they undressed each other, as she kissed his
mouth, his throat, his chest, his belly and, at last, touched the tip
of her tongue to the silk-over-steel power of his erection, she
knew that what she’d just told him was only partly true.
This—touching him, kissing him, sharing his passion—did
mean the world, but only because—because…
Because she loved him.
They had brunch, what Athenia referred to as a kolatsio, a
snack, on a terrace overlooking the water. Thick, sweet Greek
coffee. Olives. Feta cheese. Slices of warm, delicious bread and
a tray of sweet cheese pastries that Alex said were called
kalitsounia kritis.
They should have been called heavenly. The pastries were delicious
and decadent and surely fattening but Maria didn’t care.
She would not worry about anything this morning, not when life
was so perfect. Even the day was perfect. Bright. Sunny. Warm.
Unusual for the time of year, Alexandros said, and nothing like
the weather they’d left behind in New York.
The truth was, nothing was like what she’d left in New York.
Not this beautiful place. And not this wonderful, gorgeous, sexy,
strong, funny, caring, intelligent man.
132 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
Now, Maria, Sister Sarah would have cautioned, that’s far too
many adjectives.
Yes, Maria thought, but Sister had never met Alex.
He was seated across from her, talking about his house. He
loved it; she could see that in his animated face. He was proud
of it; she could hear that in his voice. How did you come to find
such a perfect house? she’d asked, and he’d said, with a boyish
grin, that he hadn’t found it, he’d built it.
And he had.
He’d worked along with the architect. With the builder. With
the carpenters. He’d wanted a house that blended into its surroundings,
that was spare and strong and unique.
“Like these cliffs,” he said.
Like you, she thought.
He told her that he’d lived in the palace until he’d gone away
to boarding school and then university, and, though he loved its
history and elegance, it had never felt like home. So, once he had
his MBA, he’d bought a condo in Ellos and another in New
York. Then, one weekend at the family compound overlooking
the turbulent waters that separated Aristo and Calista, the Strait
of Poseidon that Kitty had mentioned at dinner, it had suddenly
hit him that what he wanted was a place of his own, overlooking
the sea.
“I’d always loved driving along these cliffs so it seemed
natural to call a friend, a realtor, inquire about property, then
bring another friend, an architect, to see what he might suggest,
and—” Alex laughed. “Look at you, kardoula mou. Your beautiful
eyes are glazing over, thanks to my endless talk about
myself.” He reached for her hands, lifted them to his lips and
kissed them. “What I really want to talk about is you.”
She smiled. “My life isn’t anywhere near as interesting. And
my eyes aren’t glazing over. I love learning things about you,
Alexandros.”
She did. Oh, she did! She’d gone from hating him to loving
him in what seemed a heartbeat but the truth was, she’d fallen in
love with him that first terrible night.
SANDRA MARTON 133
“Still, I won’t say another word until you tell me about
Maria Santos.”
“It’s a dull— Hey,” she said, laughing as Alex, in one fast
move, rose from his chair, tugged her into his arms and settled
into his chair again but this time with her in his lap.
“Okay, then,” he said, “I’ll tell you about her. Maria Santos
was born twenty-five years ago. She was the most beautiful baby
anyone had ever seen.”
Maria began to laugh. “Alex, that’s silly!”
“What?” he said, his eyes round with innocence. “You mean,
you’re not twenty-five? What are you, then? Forty-five? Fiftyfive?
My God, you can’t be sixty—”
“I was not the most beautiful baby anyone had ever seen.”
“I’ll bet you were.”
“I was premature. Tiny. Skinny. Almost bald.”
“Beautiful,” Alex said, grinning, “just as I said.”
Maria rolled her eyes. “You’re crazy, Alexandros.”
“Crazy about you,” he said softly.
Could your heart really sing? She’d never heard such thrilling
words. Her prince. Her lover. HerAlexandroswas crazy about her.
“And I want to know all about you.”
That was wonderful, too. No one had ever wanted to know all
about her, not once in her entire life. Smiling, she pressed her
lips lightly to his.
“Okay,” she said softly, “here’s the entire, unexciting tale. I
was born in the Bronx. I went to school in the Bronx. Public elementary
and middle schools, and high school at Saint Mary’s.
Then I went to college in—”
“The Bronx?” Alex said, and smiled.
“You guessed it. Lehman College. I studied—”
“Art.”
She sighed and lay her head against his shoulder. “I studied
business. Mama’s idea, and I hated it. When everybody was
studying Word and Excel, I sketched. Back then, before I discovered
I loved working with metal and stones, I thought I wanted
to design clothes. Anyway, I stuck it out for a year. Then I did
134 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
what I had to do. I worked up a portfolio, arranged for an interview
at FIT—the Fashion Institute of Technology. They accepted
me, I made all the arrangements for a student loan.” She took a
breath. “Then I broke the news to Mama. I told her how hard it
was to get into FIT, I showed her my portfolio, and she said—”
“She said you had amazing talent, and that you’d be the
next—who’s that New York designer? Donna Karan?”
Maria smiled, but her smile trembled. “She said I was a
foolish girl with silly dreams.”
Alex’s arms tightened around her. “Ah, sweetheart, I’m sorry.
I should have figured…I mean, the other night—”
“No, it’s okay. Maybe it’ll help you understand why—why
she acted the way she did when you met her.” She took a deep
breath. “See, my mother never finished high school. She went to
work when she was sixteen, operating a sewing machine in the
garment center. She was determined I would not do the same,
and I couldn’t make her see that I wouldn’t end up that way.”
“And your father?”
“What about him?” she said, with a nonchalance as transparent
as glass. “He owned the company where Mama worked. He
was rich. He had a house on Long Island. He had a big car.” She
cleared her throat. “He also had a wife and kids.”
“And your poor mother had no idea…” Alex said tightly.
“She had every idea.” Maria’s voice turned brittle. “He said
he’d leave his wife and marry her—but, of course, he didn’t. And
then, when she told him she was pregnant with me, he said she
was lying. When he realized it was the truth, he gave her some
money. For an abortion, he said. But she didn’t have an abortion,
she had me instead, and he said that had been her decision, a bad
decision, and then he fired her and she never saw him again.”
Alex had gone very still. Maria bit back a groan. Whatever
had possessed her to tell him all that? She could have just told
him the first part. School. College. FIT. But the rest…Why had
she unloaded that sad, dumb story on him? She never talked
about her life. Never. Joaquin knew, but they’d grown up together.
Sela knew, but she was her best friend. No one else knew that
SANDRA MARTON 135
she was a bastard and yes, that was the right word. It was an oldfashioned
word in lots of places but in Maria’s world, the world
her mother had created and in which she had raised her, the word
still carried the smear of disgrace and dishonor.
Stupid, she told herself fiercely, how incredibly stupid, to tell
such ugly things to a man who might as well have been born and
raised on another planet.
“Well,” she said brightly, “so much for Tales from the Bronx.”
She sat forward in Alex’s lap. “This has been a lovely break,
Alex, but I have to get to work and—”
“Has he never tried to see you?”
“Who?” she said, even more brightly. “Oh, my father? No.
Why would he? I didn’t need anything from him. I wouldn’t take
anything, even if he—”
“How could a man turn his back on the woman who carried
his child? On the child herself?”
“Well, I don’t know, but—”
Alex turned her face to his, cupped it with his hands and
kissed her.
“You’re a strong, brave woman, kardia mou,” he said softly.
“And I am honored to have become your lover.”
They fell into an easy pattern, like lovers who had been together
a long time.
Not that what happened in bed lost its excitement.
It couldn’t, not when the sight of Alex coming toward her sent
Maria’s pulse skittering, not when Maria’s smile was enough to
fill Alex with such hunger that there were times he had to turn
away to keep from sweeping her into his arms and making love
to her wherever they happened to be.
He didn’t always turn away.
He made love to her in the workshop. In the garden. In the
back of the limo with the privacy screen up, bringing her to
climax with his hand high under her skirt, his mouth hot on hers.
And he made love to her in bed. The demure bed in the workshop;
the big, beautiful one in his room. They made love, and talked
136 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
and laughed, and worked—she in her workshop, he in his study
at the house. And they discovered all the things they needed to
know about each other.
Maria no longer felt ill. The early morning nausea was a thing
of the past. There were times she still felt exhausted but flu often
left you feeling tired; everyone said so.
The only dark moments came when she remembered that her
days with Alex were slipping away. The necklace was almost
finished, the big birthday celebration loomed on the horizon. A
week passed, then another, and the final week of her stay began.
When it ended, there would be nothing to keep her here.
Unless Alex asked her to stay. And she, who had spent her
life avoiding relationships, who had never imagined repeating
her mother’s foolish involvement with a man who was all
wrong for her…
She knew she would stay, if Alexandros asked her.
But he didn’t. Why would he? How would he? He was a
prince while she—she was a girl born into illegitimacy and raised
in poverty. She could have a place in Alex’s bed but she would
never have one in his life.
So she concentrated on completing the necklace until, finally,
she had only to set one of the fabulous pink stones in its center,
but she had to see the Crown of Aristo before she could do that.
The king kept making appointments for that to happen, then
cancelling them.
On a rainy afternoon just days before the queen’s birthday
party, Maria decided this couldn’t go on. Alex had a meeting in
Ellos. After he was gone, she phoned the palace, left a polite
message with Aegeus’s personal secretary. She had to see the
crown today, she said, or the queen’s gift might not be as perfect
as the king and she both wished.
She hung up the phone and was suddenly overwhelmed by
nausea. It took her by surprise. Apparently, she wasn’t over the
flu quite yet.
She barely made it to the bathroom, where shewas horribly sick.
When the spasms finally ended, she flushed the toilet, brushed
SANDRA MARTON 137
138 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
her teeth, rinsed her mouth and started for the bedroom when a
shocking wave of vertigo swept over her.
Maria stumbled and fell against the door jamb. The collision
wasn’t particularly hard but the impact was painful and hurt her
breasts. They’d grown so tender lately; even making love with
Alex, there were times the touch of his mouth on her nipples
came close to being painful…
Oh God!
Tender breasts. Nausea that seemed to have no basis. And, she
thought, biting back a moan, and a period that had not come
in…in, what? Two months? Three?
“No,” she whispered, “please, please, no…”
The phone rang. She tried to ignore it but the ringing went on
and on…
“Hello?”
It was the king’s secretary. She would be permitted to see the
crown an hour from now.
“I can’t,” Maria said, trembling as she counted back, again and
again, to the last time she’d menstruated. “How about this afternoon?
Or this evening?”
“One hour, Ms. Santos,” a commanding voice barked through
the phone, “or not at all.”
It was the king himself, and she knew he meant it.
“I’ll be there, Your Majesty,” she whispered.
She—and the illegitimate royal baby she now realized lay
cradled in her womb.
CHAPTER ELEVEN
MARIA showered quickly and dried her hair while trying not to
think about anything but the meeting with the king…
Impossible, she thought as she dropped onto the edge of the bed.
How could she be pregnant? Alex had used condoms every
time they’d made love.Well, not the very first time, almost three
months ago. Things had happened so quickly that night…
After, he’d said, “You have the right to know that I have no
diseases,” and she, embarrassed by the conversation, had thought
of telling him that she couldn’t possibly have any because she’d
never been with a man until him, but it had been easier to say
that she had none, either.
“I assume you’re on the pill,” he’d added.
Well, of course, shewasn’t. But it had been the safe time of her
cycle so she’d just nodded instead of answering and left it at that.
Maria groaned and buried her face in her hands. She thought
of all the times she’d silently wondered how her mother could
have made so many devastating mistakes. Now, she knew one
answer was that making mistakes when you were swept away
by passion was pathetically easy.
Andall the signs she’d ignored! Nausea.Wooziness. Exhaustion.
Not getting her period. That should have been the most damning
evidence of all, but she’d never been completely regular…
Maybe you didn’t see what you didn’t want to see. Maybe it
was just that simple.
140 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
She wanted to weep. To scream. To bang her fists against
the wall. That she, of all women, should have tumbled into the
age-old trap…
She knotted her hands in her lap. Took deep, calming breaths.
Hysteriawouldn’t change anything. Besides, therewas no time for
this now. The necklace. The summons from the king. Those things
came first. She had responsibilities. To the queen. To herself.
She dressed quickly. Black trousers, a black cashmere sweater
and, over it, a pale pink jacket. Black heels. Alex had followed
his gift of the emerald silk dress with what seemed like an endless
wardrobe, ordered from the pricey designer boutiques in Ellos
and delivered to the mansion.
“I can’t let you buy me things like this,” she’d protested, and
he’d kissed her to silence.
“I love giving you gifts, agapi mou,” he’d said, and because
she’d known he meant it, because nothing had turned out as she’d
anticipated and instead of only being in Alex’s bed she was also
in his life, she’d accepted the clothes and wore them when they
went out to dinner, to the theater, to the casino.
Now, the rack of expensive outfits in the dressing room—his
dressing room—was a mocking reminder that these were not
simply gifts, they were proof she was his mistress.
And mistresses did not get pregnant. They did not have babies.
They did not forge real, lasting relationships that led to a joint
future, especially with a man like Alex. A prince of the Royal
House of Karedes…
“Stop it,” she said sharply, and blanked her mind to everything
but the meeting with King Aegeus. She had worked years for this
kind of professional honor.
Right now, that was all that mattered.
Weeks before,Alex had arranged for his limo to be at her disposal.
“Don’t trust me to drive, hmm?” she’d said, laughing.
“Not on these roads, glyka mou,” he’d said, and she’d admitted
that was for the best. A born and bred New Yorker, she’d learned
to drive but she didn’t do it often or well.
SANDRA MARTON 141
Todaywould most certainly not have been a day to test her skill.
The driver had apparently been told where to take her. He
drove through the palace gates to a rear courtyard where an
equerry greeted her and led her through a maze of corridors to a
half-opened door in a gloomy alcove.
“Ms. Santos, sir.”
The king was seated at a small table, a velvet drawstring bag
before him. A chair was drawn up opposite his. Maria blinked.
Were these the royal vaults? She’d expected something different.
Bright lights. Security cameras. Guards. Not a small, plain,
ill-lit room.
“Your Majesty,” she began, but Aegeus cut her off with an imperious
wave. Another wave dismissed the equerry. Aegeus
pointed at the other chair.
“Ms. Santos. Sit down.”
His tone was hard, a direct contrast to his looks. She was surprised
by his pallor and the throb of a vein in his forehead.
“Are you—are you all right, sir?”
Aegeus glared at her. “Are you a physician as well as my
son’s mistress? Oh, don’t look so shocked, Ms. Santos. I’m not
a fool. I am aware of everything that happens in my kingdom.”
“Then you are aware that I’m here as the designer of Queen
Tia’s birthday gift, sir, nothing else.”
She knew she’d overstepped the boundary between commoner
and king but the last thing she would let happen today was a discussion
of her relationship with Alex.
To her surprise,Aegeus laughed. “I can understand Alex’s infatuation.
A woman with beauty and intelligence and spirit…”
His smile tilted. “What man could resist such temptation?”
Maria drew a deep breath. “Your Majesty. The crown…”
Aegeus pushed the velvet bag into the center of the table but
kept his hand protectively on it.
“Normally, it is kept in a display case along with the Crown
Jewels and, of course, the original Crown of Adamas.”
“Yes, sir. To tell the truth, I’m surprised that—”
“Your surprise does not interest me, Ms. Santos. I’ve arranged
to meet you here so we could keep things as simple and private
as possible.” He raised his wrist, pointedly looked at his watch
and then at her. “Five minutes. Then your time is up.”
Maria nodded and reached for the bag. The vein in the king’s
forehead seemed to leap as he lifted his hand and sat back.
She loosened the drawstring and lifted the Crown of Aristo
from it.
Her breath caught. The crown was magnificent.
Brilliant white diamonds shone like star fire even in the dim
light. Yes, she thought happily, yes, they’d match the ones in the
necklace perfectly, but it was the fantastic center stone that
dazzled the eye. The half of the pure pink Stefani diamond King
Christos had bequeathed to his son, Aegeus, and to the kingdom
of Aristo, dominated the crown.
“Beautiful,” Maria said softly.
Aegeus nodded. “Yes,” he said brusquely, and reached for the
crown.
“Wait,” Maria said quickly, pulling it back.
He looked up. The vein in his forehead looked even darker
than before. “You forget yourself, Ms. Santos.”
“I meant…Wait. Please, Your Majesty.”
“For what? You’ve seen what you came to see.”
“Iwant a closer look at the pink diamond, sir.To check its shade
against…” Maria took a small silk bag from the leather tote she
always carried when handling gems. She opened it, and the pair
of pink diamonds, one of which would become the centerpiece of
Tia’s necklace, tumbled onto the table. “To check it against these.”
The king hardly looked at the stones. “Either will match. The
colors are the same.”
Maria shook her head. “Actually, they’re not.”
“Of course they are. And your five minutes are—”
But Maria had stopped listening. A trickle of ice water seemed
to slip down her spine. She looked at the single light bulb in its
overhead socket.
“Is there…?” She cleared her throat. “Is there a way to get
more light in this room, sir?”
“No.”
142 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
“Surely we could take the crown into the display room?”
“Surely we could not,” Aegeus said coldly. “And I repeat, your
time is— What are you doing?”
Maria’s hands were trembling but she tried to stay calm. She
put the pair of pink diamonds back in their bag, put the bag in
her tote and took out a small flashlight and a jeweler’s loupe.
Quickly, she put the loupe to her eye and turned on the flashlight.
“Ms. Santos!” The king’s voice was sharp. “The Aristan
diamond is priceless. I do not want you poking at it and picking
at it and—”
“It’s a fake!” Her words seemed to explode in the confines of
the small room. She looked up, horrified. “This half of the Stefani
diamond. What’s supposed to be the Stefani diamond. It isn’t a
diamond at all.”
The king’s already pale face went paper-white. He shot to his
feet. “Give me the crown!”
“Sir. The stone is a fake. Cubic zirconium. Or something else.
It’s an excellent forgery but…” God, she was shaking like a
woman with a high fever! “Your Majesty. I have some tools in
my workshop. I can do some tests but I am sure—”
“Give me the crown!”Aegeus roared. He snatched it from her
and stuffed it into the velvet bag, but suddenly his eyes grewwide
and his face lost what little color it had.A strangled sound broke
from his throat; he clapped his hand to his heart, the bag fell on
the table and the king tumbled back into his chair.
Maria leaped to her feet, ran to the door and flung it open.
“Help!” she shouted. “Please, someone help!The king’s collapsed!”
At once, the seemingly empty corridor swarmed with people.
Maria fell back against the wall. Someone scooped everything
from the table—the loupe, the flashlight and the velvet bag—
dumped them into her leather tote, thrust the tote at her, then
grasped her arm, hurried her out of the palace and to Alex’s
waiting limousine.
It wasn’t until she was back at the guesthouse that she realized
the crown of Aristo had gone home with her.
* * *
SANDRA MARTON 143
What did you do when you had absconded with a royal crown?
Maria sat at herworkbench, staring blindly at the crown as she
tried to come to grips with all that had happened today. The
wrenching realization that she was pregnant. The horrifying discovery
that the half of the Stefani diamond in the Aristan crown
was not a diamond at all and then, the king’s collapse.
Was Aegeus dead? Had her news killed him?
She’d phoned the palace. Useless. She had the private telephone
number of the queen’s personal secretary but reached only
her voice mail. Desperate for diversion, she’d filled the time
running tests on the pink stone in the crown, praying all the
while that her initial judgment had been wrong.
She’d done a dozen tests, everything from the silly—did the
stone fog when she blew on it?—to the absolutely, completely
scientific.
She’d used an electronic tool called a diamond tester. She’d
brought it out last, as if by holding off she could avoid the truth.
The tester had been one of the things she’d brought with her from
NewYork; she hadn’t even been aware she had it with her until now.
The thing was a complex piece of equipment but it was simple
to operate. Turn it on, touch the probe at one end of it to a stone.
If the stonewas a real diamond, a green light came on. If itwasn’t…
If it wasn’t, nothing happened.
Nothing had happened, half a dozen times.
Maybe the tester wasn’t working. That had been her hope.
So she’d touched the probe to every white diamond in the
crown. To the diamonds in Tia’s almost-completed necklace. To
the two big pink stones she’d taken to the palace.
The green light blinked on each time.
Then she’d touched it to the pink stone in the Aristan crown.
Please, she’d prayed, please let the green light come on.
It didn’t.
The stone was a brilliant, beautiful fake. It would fool
anybody. Anybody but an expert.
Still, maybe she was wrong. Maybe she’d missed something.
144 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
Was there a test she’d forgotten? Anything was possible, she told
herself, and reached for the phone.
Far across the ocean, Joaquin answered on the first ring.
“Maria,” he said happily, on hearing her voice. “¿Como se va?
Sela was just saying—”
“Joaquin. I need your help.”
He was not a GG—a Graduate Gemologist—as she was. The
degree had cost her a small fortune; shewas still carrying the debt.
But his depth and breadth of knowledge was excellent, and she
knewshe could trust him with this devastating news. She told him
what she’d discovered. Described the tests she’d run. Their conversation
grew complex, touched on things like heating, magnification,
trigons and dodecahedral surfaces of octahedral crystal
formations and then, finally, she took a deep breath and told him
she’d used a diamond tester.And the stone had failed that final test.
“You’re sure the tester is working properly?”
“I checked the battery. And it gave a green light, literally, to
a couple of dozen diamonds, pink and white.”
“But not this one.”
“No,” Maria said, “not this one.”
Joaquin’s sigh drifted through the telephone. “I don’t envy you,
chica.You are about to be the bearer of very bad news for someone.”
She gave a sad little laugh. “I’m afraid I already am.”
“Call me if you need me. Sela says to tell you she can do
without me for a few days. We both love you, you know that.”
She smiled. “Doing without you, even for a few days, is impossible.
I love you, too, Joaquin. With all my—”
“How cozy.”
Maria spun around. Alexandros stood in the doorway, arms
folded, legs apart, face stony and cold.
“Alexandros! I didn’t hear you come in.”
“No. Obviously not. Don’t let me interrupt you, Maria. Not
when you’re in the middle of an obviously important call.”
She said a quick “goodbye” to Joaquin and hung up the phone.
Then she slid from the stool and went to her lover. He didn’tmove.
Didn’t smile. Didn’t react at all when she put her hand on his arm.
SANDRA MARTON 145
“Your father—”
“I know all about my father.”
“Is he—is he—”
“He’s in the hospital. He had a heart attack.” Alex’s mouth
narrowed. “Thanks to you.”
“I never meant—”
“What did you say to him? Did you perhaps tell him you were
sleeping with me even though you miss your lover in NewYork?”
His mouth twisted. “No. Why would you do that when you’ve
been so careful to hide that information from me?”
“Alexandros. Listen to me. I don’t have—”
“Liar!” He caught her by the shoulders, his hands rough on
her tender flesh, and drewher to her toes, just as he had after their
first night together. “It’s the same man you were talking to that
morning three months ago.” When she said nothing, his face
contorted. “Answer me, damn you! Admit it.”
“I was talking with Joaquin, yes. But—”
“Can’t you do without him for another few days?”
“Alexandros.” Her voice broke. “You’re wrong about him.”
“I was wrong about you, you mean.”
“I told you, Joaquin works for me. He’s married.”
“What would that matter to a woman like you?”
Maria felt the insult like a knife to the heart. She jerked free
of his hands, her face white, eyes glittering with tears.
“I don’t deserve that,” she whispered.
Yes, he thought, she did. She deserved that and more. He had
taken her to his bed. Held her in his arms as she slept. Awakened
her with his kisses. He had shared his life with her these past weeks.
Fool that he was, he’d come to—to care for her. To want her more
than he’d ever wanted anything or anyone in his entire life.
He’d even imagined—he’d stupidly imagined he might keep
her with him after her work here was over.
He turned away. Composed himself. She was just another
woman. More beautiful, perhaps. More intelligent. More fun. In
the end, though, she was the same as all the others. She was with
him because of who he was. Because of the power he wielded.
146 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
Because hewas a prince, not a man. He had to remember that.
She was his mistress, bought and paid for. She was not his
lover; she was not in his bed of her own free will but because he
had demanded her presence there.
He took a breath and looked at her. “What did you say to my
father?” His voice was cold. “He was fine at the start of his
meeting with you.”
“He wasn’t. He looked ill.”
“Answer the question.What did you do to make him collapse?”
Maria stared at Alex. He was looking at her as he had not done
in weeks, as if he were an autocrat and she were his to command.
His expression radiated scorn—and maybe she deserved it. She’d
slept with a man who’d made it clear he wanted her sexually, not
any other way.
And she’d fallen in love with him.
Wasn’t she repeating a pattern for which she’d vilified her
mother—up to and including the shame of becoming pregnant?
God. Oh, God! How had she let this happen? And what would
she do next? End the pregnancy? Have the baby? Raise it, alone,
as her mother had raised her? Because it was only in fairy tales
that the handsome prince married the beautiful commoner and
lived with her happily ever after.
“I’m waiting, Maria.”
She wrapped her arms around herself. Lifted her chin. Forced
herself to meet Alex’s steely gaze without flinching.
“I told him something about the Aristan crown.”
“And?”
“And, it upset him. I’m sorry for that but I was—I was
shocked myself and I just blurted it out—”
“Blurted out what? I’m not in the mood for games, Maria.”
Maria swallowed dryly. Her lover was a prince of the house
of Karedes. He had to know the truth.
“I told him—I told him the half of the Stefani diamond in the
crown wasn’t real.”
For a long moment, nothing happened. Then Alex laughed.
The sound startled her.
SANDRA MARTON 147
“You told the king that a stone that is beyond price wasn’t
real?” His laughter ended as quickly as it had begun. “And he
called you, what? A liar? A fool? An idiot? Or all three?”
“It isn’t real,” Maria said quietly. “It’s an excellent fake—but
a fake, nevertheless.”
Alex’s face darkened. “He should have had you thrown out
for spouting such nonsense!”
“Listen to me, Alex.”
“No, glyka mou, you listen to me! I don’t know what you
thought to accomplish with such a lie but—”
“The stone’s counterfeit!” Maria grabbed the crown from the
workbench along with a stack of papers and shoved all of it into
his hands. “Here’s the crown.”
“You took it out of the palace?—”
“I didn’t plan to take it but… Never mind the details. Look at
my notes. I ran endless tests. That’s why I phoned Joaquin, to see
if maybe, just maybe therewas something I missed. Therewasn’t.
The Aristan pink diamond isn’t a diamond at all!”
Alex stared at her. Then he began leafing through the papers,
quickly at first and then, as he began to absorb what she’d written,
more and more slowly. He stared at the crown. At the papers.
Finally, he looked up.
“I don’t understand. Who would have done this? And how?
The crown’s been in the vault for years.”
Maria spread her hands. “I have no answers. I only know the
diamond is a fake.”
Alex put down the papers and the crown, and ran a hand
through his hair. “You’re sure? There’s no possibility of error?”
“I’m a Graduate Gemologist,” she said softly. “I’ve appraised
lots and lots of diamonds. I even did some work with an insurance
company that involved fraud and a diamond that would
have been worth millions, had it been real.” She paused. “I
phoned Joaquin because he’s knowledgeable. And completely
trustworthy.”
Alex’s mouth thinned. “I’ll just bet he is.”
“Damn it, stop being a fool! I phoned him that morning in
148 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
your apartment to tell him I thought I had a good shot at winning
the competition because I knew how much it mattered to him
and his wife. And I called him now to pick his brain. He’s not
my lover. He never has been. He’s married to my best friend and
he’s my friend, too. I can trust him to keep quiet about this—or
am I wrong, thinking you don’t want the citizens of Aristo
learning the truth about the diamond from the front pages of the
world’s newspapers?”
A muscle flickered in Alex’s jaw. She was right about the need
for discretion. The diamond was priceless, not only as a stone
but as a symbol. No Aristan ruler could ever be crowned without
it. There was also his grandfather’s pronouncement, what
everyone called King Christos’s Legacy, the pledge that both
halves of the Stefani diamond would have to be joined together
in the crown of Adamas if ever the two kingdoms, Calista and
Aristo, were to be reunited.
And then, he thought, looking at Maria, then there was
Maria herself.
Maria, who had brought him the kind of joy he’d never
expected to find. What he’d told himself a little while ago was a
lie. She’d come to Aristo because he’d forced her to do so, yes,
but that was in the past. She was here now because it was what
they both wanted. He couldn’t imagine ending the day without
sharing a few quiet moments with her as they stood in each
other’s arms, watching the sun set over his beloved island.
Couldn’t imagine opening his eyes in the morning and not
finding her in his arms again.
As for Joaquin… He’d seen his Maria with him but, really, what
had he seen?A man putting his arms around a woman.A kiss, but
were either the embrace or the kiss those of lovers? Had she lifted
her face to Joaquin as she lifted hers to him? Had she drawn
Joaquin’s head down to hers? Had anything about that kiss held
the heat, the power of what happened between his Maria and him?
God, hewas a fool.Accusing her of things he knew, in his heart,
were not true. Things she would never do. He had to tell her what
she’d come to mean to him, that he didn’twant her to leave him…
SANDRA MARTON 149
“I only wish,” she said brokenly, “I just wish I’d broken the
news to your father differently. Perhaps, if I had—”
“It’s all right, glyka mou.”
“No. It isn’t. I upset him. His heart—”
“His heart is undamaged. He’s at the hospital, yes, but he’s
awake and alert.”
“Thank God,” she said, and then she began to weep.
“Ah, sweetheart.”Alex gathered her into his arms. “Don’t cry.”
She wept harder, her face pressed against his shoulder. He
could feel her tears dampening his shirt.
“Forgive me for blaming you for what happened. Discovering
the stone is fake must have been terrible.”
Maria lifted her face to his. “It was horrible. Horrible, Alexandros!
I couldn’t believe it. That was why I called Joaquin—”
“I spoke before I thought,” he said gruffly, framing her face
between his hands. “An old failing, I’m afraid. Ask my brothers.
Or my sisters.” He smiled. “They’ll tell you the same thing. I hear
something, I get upset, I react.” He clasped her chin, lifted her
mouth to his and kissed her. “Will you forgive me?”
Their eyes met, his dark with anguish, hers bright with tears.
Would she forgive him? How could she do anything else? She
loved this man with all her heart. He had been through an awful
shock about his father. She could grant him some leeway,
couldn’t she?
And she carried his child.
She had to tell him. She knew she did. They had created this
tiny life together. No matter what the consequences, Alexandros
had the right to know. She was not her mother and he was not a
clone of her father.
“Maria? Please, sweetheart, say you’ll forgive me.”
“You know I will,” she said softly, smiling through her tears.
Alex let out a long breath. “Glyka mou.We must talk.About us.”
“Yes. We do.”
“But not now.” He held her closer. “The next days are going
to be hectic. I’ll have to tell my family about the Stefani diamond.
150 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
We’ll have to meet with the council and decide how to handle
this. And there’s my mother’s birthday…”
“Can you postpone the celebration?”
“My father has already said it must go on as scheduled.”
“But if he’s ill…”
“This is a national celebration, sweetheart. Royal responsibility
to the people comes before everything else.” He frowned. “And
nowthat I knowthis about the diamond, Iwonder ifmyfather isn’t
concerned that his illness should not seem too important.You see,
if something should happen to him, if a new king had to be
crowned… That could not happen unless the real diamond were
found and placed in the crown. Do you understand?”
Maria nodded. Like most little girls, she’d loved fairy tales.
Now she knew, first-hand, that real kings and queens and princes
and princesses did not live such easy lives.
That fairy tales didn’t always end happily, she thought, and a
shudder went through her.
“What is it, agapoula mou?”
“Nothing,” she said quickly. “Just—I’m just thinking of how
busy everyone will be the next few days.”
“We’ll manage. I, especially, because I’ll have you beside me.”
Alex bent to her and kissed her. Whispered soft words against
her lips. Her arms crept around his neck. Now, she told herself.
Never mind that there’s no time for real talking. Let him ask you
to stay with him, and you can tell him about the baby—
His cell phone rang. He blanched as he grabbed it from his
pocket.
“Ne?” he said brusquely.
But it wasn’t the hospital, it was Andreas. The conversation
was brief. When it ended, Alex drew her against him.
“I can’t stay, sweetheart. I must meet with Sebastian and
Andreas. There are many things to discuss, and now is as good
a time as any to tell them about the diamond.”
She nodded. “Tell them, too, how sorry I am.”
“You have nothing to be sorry for, glyka mou.” His lips curved
in a smile. “But if you feel you must show contrition for some
SANDRA MARTON 151
152 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
imagined misdeed, I’ll consider letting you find creative ways
to do so later on.”
She laughed and kissed him, and when he whispered something
that made her blush, she kissed him again.
“Tonight,” she promised.
He gathered up the papers and the Aristan crown; he put his
arm around her as they walked to the door.
“Tonight,” he said softly.
But one night became another and then another. The mystery
of the diamond, the king’s illness, the birthday celebration on the
horizon… Alex was caught up in the politics of the palace.
There was no time for anything else.
CHAPTER TWELVE
THE day of the queen’s birthday celebration was an anomaly.
It was winter, when cool winds and rain often lashed Aristo,
but this day dawned bright and warm.
Alex hardly noticed.Hehad not been home since he’d left Maria
in the guesthouse. He’d returned the crown to the display case in
the vault and, ever since, he’d been closeted with his brothers.
They were trying to come up with answers. Where was the
missing diamond?Whohad stolen it?When?Howcould the switch
have gone unnoticed? Where did they start searching for the real
stone? Most pressing of all, how could they keep it all a secret?
And it had to be a secret. They could not permit word to get
out that the stone was gone.
On the simplest level, news like that would be humiliating.
Far more unsettling were the possible political consequences.
What if a Calistan sheikh somehow gained control of the
diamond? Could he then twist the true meaning of King
Christos’s legacy, join the Aristan stone to the one in the Crown
of Calista, and claim the right to rule both kingdoms?
It was a real possibility, one that might well destroy Aristo.
Hemissed Maria terribly. Her smile. Her quiet strength.The feel
of her in his arms.Hephoned her whenever he could: even the sound
of her soft voice was an oasis of calm in the middle of a storm.
“I miss you, glyka mou,” he told her softly.
She missed him, too. Terribly. But she understood that he was
154 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
needed at the palace. Sometimes, she could forget her lover was
a prince. Now, she couldn’t escape it. So, rather than burden him
with her own feelings, she did what she thought was right. She
said she missed him, too, but she was busy.
“Even if you were here,Alexandros, I couldn’t spend time with
you. I have last-minute work to do on your mother’s necklace.”
“Oh,” he said, just that one word, but he sounded disappointed.
She almost told him she was lying, that she missed him
so badly she ached, that if he came through the door she’d toss
everything aside and run into his arms…
But the last thing he needed now was a clinging female. Her
Alex, along with Sebastian and Andreas, were like jugglers
trying to keep a dozen balls in the air. Elissa had just arrived
home. She and Kitty were busy helping their mother get ready
for the party.
The king had come home from the hospital against the advice
of his doctors. The heart attack had not done any damage, true,
but they wanted other tests. Nonsense, said Aegeus. There were
affairs of state to deal with. Tia’s birthday. All the media attention
the celebration had brought. Scores of foreign dignitaries.
“I am fine,” he insisted.
Was he? The brothers thought their father looked ill.
“Actually,” Sebastian said, “he looks like hell.”
It was an accurate assessment. The king was pale. He seemed
to have shrunk in size and there was a constant sheen of sweat
on his forehead. And why did he never mention the missing
diamond? That seemed strangest of all.
“If we can just get through the celebration tonight…” Alex
said, and they all agreed. Get through tonight and then they could
institute a real if subtle search for the missing stone.
Alex was going home to shower and change. “We’ll have
half an hour alone, sweetheart,” he said when he phoned Maria,
“but we can make the most of that half hour.” He told her how
they’d do that, in explicit detail, and she gave a sexy little sigh
and said she’d be waiting.
Smiling, he flipped his cell phone shut. He needed that thirty
SANDRA MARTON 155
minutes, not just to make love to her but to tell her what he’d started
to tell her three days ago. What he should have told her weeks ago.
He didn’t want her to leave him.
Once she gave the necklace to the king, once the king presented
it to the queen, Maria would go back to New York.
He could not imagine letting that happen.
They were at the start of their relationship, not the end. In the
last month, she had become part of him. She was—she was everything
to him. Sometimes, when he held her close, he wanted
to tell her—to tell her—
“Alex?” Andreas was hurrying toward him. “Change in plans.
Last-minute stuff. Sebastian’s meeting with that guy from the
BBC, I’m going to talk to CNN. Kitty’s doing a piece with The New
York Times. Lissa was going to deal with Newsweek but Mother
needs her, something about the flowers. Can you take her spot?”
Alex looked at his watch. “I have to get home, Andreas.”
“You mean,” his brother said, smiling, “youwant to see Maria.”
“No, of course not. It’s just that my tux is at home…” Alex
sighed. “You’re right. I do.”
“Well, you’ll see her soon enough. The party starts in a couple
of hours. Let your driver pick up your tux, okay? If you don’t take
over for Lissa, we’ll be up the creek without a paddle.”
Alex hesitated, but what choice was there? He couldn’t walk
away from his duty, no matter what his own needs. He hoped
Maria would understand.
She did more than understand. She said that it was just as well,
she still had to do her nails and her hair. He said fine, he was glad
it had all worked out, but he was lying.
What he’dwanted her to saywas that she’d been longing for him.
That it was agony to know they would not have half an hour alone.
Hehad noway of knowing that Mariawas lying, too. She’d been
counting the hours untilAlex came to her, but she couldn’t tell him
that. She needed the feel of his arms around her.And then therewas
her pregnancy. She had to find the right time to tell him about it.
But when?
He was, after all, a man with all the responsibilities of a life
completely different from hers. He might see her as an exciting
lover but that was all she was, all she ever could be…
Her throat tightened.
Maybe she wouldn’t tell him about the baby. Not just yet,
anyway.
Not until the time was right.
The evening started with a flourish.
A dozen royal heralds played a trumpet fanfare at the top of
the marble steps that led into the huge ballroom. A velvet curtain
at the far end was drawn back and the queen swept in on the
king’s arm. The hundreds of guests smiled and applauded her
arrival. Every eye was on the radiant Tia.
Every eye but Alex’s.
He was waiting at the opposite end of the enormous room,
waiting and watching for Maria. Where was she?
“Alexandros,” a voice whispered, and he turned and there she
was, standing behind him, so gorgeous in a silk gown the color
of fine sherry, her dark hair tumbling down her back in a profusion
ofwaves and curls accented with tiny ruby and diamond stars
he’d had sent to her, that the sight of her almost stopped his heart.
He didn’t think, didn’t hesitate but took her hands, drew her
through the crowd and out to the terrace, took her in his arms and
kissed her.
She melted against him.
“Maria,” he said softly, “kardoula mou, you are the most
beautiful woman in the world.”
Her mouth curved against his. “And you, my prince, are the
most handsome man on the planet.”
He kissed her again. “I hoped you’d be here before the celebration
started.”
“The car,” she said, on a little laugh. “We had a flat tire. Don’t
let on that you know, Alex. Poor Alastor felt awful.”
“As he should,” Alex said, but he smiled. “Never mind.
You’re here now. That’s what matters. Did you give the necklace
to my father?”
156 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
Maria nodded. “He seemed pleased with it. He said he’ll
give it to your mother at midnight.” She hesitated. “Is he all
right? He looks—”
“Terrible. I know. We tried to convince him to cancel but he
refused.” Alex gathered her closer against him. “Let’s not talk
about that,” he said softly. “Not when I have something important
to discuss with you.”
Now was the time to say that she did, too.
“Maria.” Gently, he brushed a curl from her forehead. “I know
you’re supposed to… I mean, I know we agreed you would…”
Alex groaned. “I’m making a mess of this, glyka mou. What I’m
trying to say is—”
“Your Highness! Prince Alexandros!”
An equerry was running toward them. Alex knew, before the
man said another word, that the news was of his father.
“The king?”
The equerry nodded. “He’s been taken ill, sir.”
Alex ran into the ballroom. Maria hiked up her skirt and ran
at his side.
“Where is he?”
“The throne room, sir. There’s a helicopter on its way. Your
Highness?” The equerry, running with them, caught Alex by the
sleeve just before they reached the throne room. The simple
actionwas so unprecedented that it startled even Maria. “The king
wishes to see Ms. Santos.” He swallowed audibly. “Alone.”
“Me?” Maria said, in amazement. “That can’t be.”
The Karedes family was gathered outside the closed doors of
the throne room, faces white and puzzled. When Maria hesitated,
the queen motioned her forward.
“My husband wants to see you, Ms. Santos.” Tia bit her lip.
“Please. I don’t think there’s time to waste.”
“Go on,” Alex said softly, and touched his hand to her cheek.
The doors closed behind her with an audible click.
This was Maria’s first visit to the throne room. It was not as
big as she’d imagined, the size, perhaps, of half her loft, but it
SANDRA MARTON 157
was elegant. A red carpet stretched toward a pair of ornate chairs
that stood on a raised platform but the chairs—presumably, the
thrones—were empty.
“Here,” a weak voice said.
The king was alone. He lay on a crimson velvet sofa, head
elevated on a blue silk pillow.
Maria moved slowly toward him. Her heart thumped. He’s
dying, she thought, and, as if he’d read her mind, Aegeus struggled
up against the pillow.
“I am not dead yet, Ms. Santos. Come forward.”
“Your Majesty. Your family is outside. Surely, you want to see
them—”
“You were not supposed to learn that the diamond in the
crown is false.”
Maria caught her breath. “You knew?”
The king’s face contorted. He groaned and Maria swung
toward the door to call for help but Aegeus’s fingers wrapped
around her wrist with the steely grip of command.
“My son is in love with you.”
She stared at him. “What?”
“Alexandros loves you, Ms. Santos. I’m not sure he knows it
yet, but he does.” He drew a rasping breath. “But you must not
return that love.”
Maria shook her head. “Your Majesty. Please. You’re very
sick—”
“All the more reason for you to pay attention to what I say,”
he said, a touch of the old sharpness edging hiswords. “You must
understand that there is no room in a royal’s life for love.”
“Sir. This is hardly the time—”
“A prince is not born to his mother or father, Ms. Santos, he
is born to his nation and his people. His life, from birth, is one
of responsibility. Commitment. Obligation.” Aegeus took another
labored breath. “Someday, my sons will marry. They will marry
young women born of blood as royal as theirs, young women
who understand what is expected of them.”
Maria sank to her knees beside the sofa. She could feel the
158 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
sting of tears in her eyes and she blinked furiously to keep them
from falling.
“I love your son,” she whispered. “And I understand he has
responsibilities. I can help him shoulder them. I can step back
when I must.”
“If you truly love him, you will give him up.”
“No. No! You can’t ask that of me. Or of him. If Alexandros
loves me—”
“His duty is to his people. To his mother. To me. A prince who
falls in love with the wrong woman can only destroy her. He can
only destroy his nation and himself. Maria. If you love my son
as you say you do, you will leave him. And you will not tell him
the reason. Alexandros must never know you love him, or that
you gave him up because you love him. You must walk away
from him, from his life, and never look back.”
Tears streamed down Maria’s face.
“You ask too much of me,” she said. “You have no right!”
“I love my country and my people. And though you may not
think so, I love my children.” The king took a long, agonizing
breath. “Alex thinks you willmake him happy but youwon’t, Maria.
Your love can only hurt him.You must, you must, set him free.”
“Your Majesty—”
The king jerked upright. His hand went to his throat; his
breath rattled though a mouth gone wide, gasping for air.
Maria sprang to her feet.
“Help,” she shouted.
“Maria,” Aegeus whispered hoarsely.
“Someone, help—”
The door swung open. Footsteps clattered against the marble
floor. And, as they did, Aegeus grabbed Maria’s hand again.
“Promise me,” he said fiercely. “Swear that you will do what
you know you must.”
Weeping, Maria stared at the king’s stricken face—and knew
he was right. She could not share Alexandros’s life. He was a
prince and she—she was nobody.
“I swear,” she said.
SANDRA MARTON 159
160 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
A smile pulled Aegeus’s lips back from his teeth—and then he
fell back against the pillows. His family surrounded him.The queen
sank to the floor beside him, took his hand and began to weep.
“He’s gone,” she said, “he’s gone!”
Alex gently drew her to her feet. Sebastian put his arm around
her. Andreas touched her shoulder. Kitty and Lissa bent over their
father and sobbed.
And Maria did the only thing she could. The thing Aegeus had
asked of her. The promise she had made him that she knew, in
her heart of hearts, was right.
She slipped from the room, from the palace.
From Alexandros’s life.
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
A MONARCH’S death left behind a void that must be filled quickly
for the safety and stability of the kingdom and its people.
At first, all was confusion.
Despite Aegeus’s illness, his death had been sudden. The
king’s private physicians tried every possible means to revive him
but to no avail. The Karedes family clustered around the king’s
lifeless body; the palace, filled with guests for the queen’s
birthday celebration, buzzed with rumors. Andreas comforted his
sisters. Sebastian, who as eldest son would, within hours, be
named the Prince Regent, was immediately surrounded by guards
whose duty it was to protect him, especially in times of turmoil.
Alex held his mother in his arms.
Through it all—the loss of his father, his mother’s tears, his
sister’s sobs, the stunned reactions of his brothers and his own
shock—through all that, Alex found himself looking over the
heads of those who’d crowded into the room. Where was Maria?
He needed her. And, surely, she needed him. She’d been alone
with his father at the moment of his death.
She needed his comfort. His arms.And he, God, he needed her.
A reporter and a couple of photographers had somehow
slipped into the room; two of the guards were hustling them out.
Had those guards, in error, forced Maria aside?
He was desperate to find her but Tia was distraught. He
couldn’t leave her, not until she was calmer. He told himself not
162 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
to worry. His Maria was smart. She was resourceful. She’d find
his car, have his driver take her home. Or she’d wait for him in
a quiet corner of the palace.
Soon, he’d be alone with her. And he’d tell her what he now
knew had been in his heart for weeks. He loved her. He adored
her. He could not imagine life without her.
He didn’t just want her to stay here, on Aristo, as his lover.
He wanted her to become his wife.
One thing about death, he thought as he led his mother from
the room. It had a profound way of making a man see what
really mattered.
And what mattered, the only thing that mattered, was Maria.
In the face of a nation’s grief and loss, tradition became its solace.
Aegeus would lie in state for three days. The Accession
Council would meet to formally name Sebastian the Prince
Regent, though by tradition coupled with the decades-old decree
of Christos, there could be no coronation of him as king until the
missing half of the Stefani diamond was returned to the Aristan
crown. The Privy Council would meet, too, so its members could
certify the succession declaration.
Andreas took on the coordination of those meetings.
Sebastian immersed himself in policy conferences. It fell to
Alex to finalize plans for the royal funeral. And yet, as he raced
home just before dawn, his thoughts were not on any of those
things. He was consumed by worries over something far more
important.
Maria.
She hadn’t beenwaiting for him in the palace, not in the public
rooms or in the royal apartments. His driver was waiting, in the
courtyard, and in response toAlex’s questions the man could only
shake his head and say that he had not seen Ms. Santos.
Alex checked his cell phone. Again. He’d already done that
a dozen times but maybe, now, she’d left a message… She hadn’t.
He’d phoned her endlessly and been connected to her voice mail,
where he’d gone from leaving messages telling her he would
SANDRA MARTON 163
break away as soon as he possibly could to increasingly terse
ones asking her to contact him.
By the time he reached the house on the bay, he was frantic.
“Maria?” he shouted as he burst through the door. “Maria?”
No answer. He ran up the stairs to his bedroom, flung open
the door. The room was dark. Empty.
“Maria,” he said again, and flew down the stairs, almost stumbling
over Athenia who stood at the bottom wearing a housecoat,
her hair in curlers.
“Your Highness. Our hearts are filled with grief. We are all
so sorry for you—”
“Yes. Thank you. Where is Ms. Santos?”
Athenia bit her lip. Shook her head. Alex cursed in frustration—
and then breathed a sigh of relief. He knew where Maria
would be. In the guesthouse. He knew her habits. She was
probably losing herself in work.
But the guesthouse, Maria’s workshop, stood as silent and
empty as his bedroom. Something about that silence made his
heart rise in his throat. He ran back to the main house, took the
steps two at a time, flung open the bedroom door, this time
switched on the light…
And knew, instantly, that Maria was gone.
The room felt cold. Not just empty but barren, as if the very life
had been stripped from it. He went to the dressing room, stepped
inside. Her suitcase was gone. The beautiful clothes he’d bought
her hung from the racks like mournful reminders of the past.
“Maria,” Alex said, bewildered. What the hell had happened?
Where was his Maria? He turned in a slow circle—and saw the
envelope propped on the bed. “Alex,” it said, and that it didn’t
say Alexandros was a statement in itself.
He picked it up. Opened it.Withdrew the note inside and read
it. It was brief. She was, she said, terribly sorry for his loss.
Though she’d only met his father a handful of times, she’d come
to respect him. She’d wanted to tell him that herself but…
The “but” made Alex’s belly knot.
But, she wrote, she knew that the king’s death meant Alex
would be immersed in the duties of a prince. She saw no reason to
burden him with concern for her, especially since she was returning
to NewYork anyway, nowthat her duties here were completed.
Her duties here.
He looked up, his face a mask of disbelief.Was that what it had
been? Had sleeping with him been part of her duties?Was leaving
him such a relief that she couldn’t have waited to say goodbye?
He read the note again. And again. Then he let out a roar of
anguished rage from a place in his soul he’d never known existed,
and tore the note into a dozen pieces.
A state funeral was not a simple thing.
Fortunately, plans for events like this had always existed.
Except for the addition of a motorcade, those plans had not
changed much since the time of the Crusades.
Aegeus lay in state for three days while his people, friends,
relatives and foreign heads of state all paid their respects.
The Sheikh King Zakari Al’Farisi represented the island of
Calista.
Zakari, a proud and ruthless man, made all the appropriate
comments to the press; he offered Tia his polite condolences.
In private talks with the Karedes princes, however, Zakari’s
words were probing as well as troubling.
He seemed to know that Aristo’s half of the Stefani diamond
was missing.
Though Alex, Andreas and Sebastian had met with their
council and agreed the mystery had to be kept secret until it was
solved, that decision was—as Andreas wryly put it—pretty much
the equivalent of shutting the stable door after the horse had
been stolen.
Clearly, the news had reached Calista. And that was dangerous.
Since Sebastian could not be crowned without the true
diamond, Alex’s worry—that it might fall into the wrong hands
and a Calistan prince could take the Aristan throne—seemed
more and more plausible.
Added to concerns of state were those of family. Lissa and
164 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
Kitty took their father’s death hard and clung to Andreas. Tia,
shocked by her loss, claimed Alex for solace and support.
Sebastian, now the Prince Regent, was, by custom, designated
to lead them all through the necessary formalities.
Alex had no time to think, or told himself he had no time for
it. But at night, when the hands of his watch seemed to slow to a
crawl, he lay awake in his palace rooms, despising Maria, despising
himself, telling himself what a fool he’d been to have imagined
himself in love with her because he certainly had not loved her.
Of course, he hadn’t.
He counted down the days until the formalities of mourning
would end. He had work to do, investors to meet with and
reassure that nothing would change on Aristo. He was also fully
involved in organizing the search for the missing diamond. Once
the mourning period was behind him, he’d be far too busy to
think about Maria Santos.
A lie.
Life slowly returned to normal. He was busy from early
morning until late at night.And he thought about her all the time.
What he needed was closure, to tell her, to her face, that she
had meant nothing more to him than he had obviously meant to
her, but that would mean seeking her out and he wasn’t about to
lower himself to that.
Strangely, no one in his family asked about Maria until one
morning, when his mother phoned and invited him to breakfast.
He was incredibly busy that day but he knew Tia’s grief was still
new; nothing would have made him refuse her request.
They chatted briefly about nothing special—and then, without
warning, Tia asked why Maria had gone.
“Why wouldn’t she?” Alex said, with a shrug. “She finished
your necklace. Her work was over.”
“I’m not talking about her work,” Tia said. “I’m talking about
the feelings you and she have for each other.”
“You’re wrong, Mother. We had no—”
“Alex. I’m your mother. I’m also a woman. I know love when
I see it. Maria and you were in love. So, why did you let her go?”
SANDRA MARTON 165
Alex thought of half a dozen answers, all of which would have
worked—and, instead, found himself speaking the truth.
“I didn’t,” he said in a low voice. “She left me. She enjoyed—
she enjoyed our time together but—”
“Nonsense. She loves you. I saw it. Everyone saw it.”
“The hell she did!” Alex shot to his feet. “She left the night
Father died. What was I supposed to do? Go after her? Walk out
on my duties to try and convince her not to leave me?”
“Your duties,” Tia said softly. “Yes. Such things always get
in the way.” She looked up at him. “Had you ever told her you
loved her?”
His mouth thinned. “No.”
“Perhaps,” she said carefully, “perhaps you should have.”
Yes, Alex thought, he should have. He’d known the truth, in
his heart. Why hadn’t he faced it sooner? Now it was too late.
“It’s never too late,” his mother said, and he realized he’d
spoken aloud. “Alexandros. Love is a precious gift. Don’t
throw it away.”
“How do you know that, Mother? I know you respected Father
but I don’t believe you truly loved him.” Alex drew a ragged
breath. “Hell,” he said softly, “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have—”
“You spoke the truth, my son. I didn’t truly love Aegeus, nor
did he truly love me.” The queen’s eyes shone with unshed tears.
“And that’s exactly the reason you must not let love slip through
your fingers, Alexandros. Even a royal is entitled to happiness.”
The New York weather was harsh and uninviting.
Snow, slush, sleet and grey skies were daily companions.
The sun seemed reluctant to put in even a cursory appearance.
The weather was a reflection of Maria’s despair. She was
lonely for Alexandros, for Aristo, for the happiness she had
found with him there.
It was good that she was busy. Shops that had not wanted any
part of her in the past clamored for her designs. L’Orangerie
headed the list.
And, well, yes, there was one other good thing. A miracu-
166 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
lous thing that had, at first, terrified her and now made her
heart sing with joy.
Avisit to her doctor had confirmed that shewas pregnant. She
was carrying Alex’s child.A little girl, Sela had said, smiling.
“Morning sickness at the beginning of your pregnancy. And
look how high you’re carrying. Absolutely, a girl.”
Maria didn’t believe in the old superstitions but it didn’t
matter. Shewould love her baby whatever the sex, and shewould
name it for Alexandros even though he was gone from her life.
He, and Aristo, were moving forward. Sebastian was the
Prince Regent, though there was no mention of the missing
diamond. She’d followed the funeral on TV. The royal family had
looked saddened but composed. Alex had been his mother’s
strong, handsome escort.
Just seeing him had made Maria’s throat constrict.
She would never stop loving him.
But she would have his daughter to love. It saddened her that
her baby would never know her daddy but when Alexandra was
old enough, she’d tell her what a fine man he was, what a loving
man, what a good man—and never mind that he hadn’t called or
written or tried to find out how she was, where she was…
“Maria? You okay?”
She looked up at Joaquin, working at the end of the bench.
He and Sela had been wonderful. Though they knew about the
baby, they hadn’t asked questions. A good thing, too, because if
they had, she might have broken down and wept.
Tears filled her eyes and dripped onto thewax shewasworking.
“Maria?”
“Yes,” she said briskly, wiping the back of her hand across her
eyes and flashing a smile, “I’m fine. I just—I think I got a bit of
wax in my eye.”
“Want me to do that mold?”
“No. No, thanks. I’m almost finished. You know, it’s getting
late. Why don’t we call it a day, hmm?”
“Well, if that’s okay… I promised Sela I’d pick up some stuff
from the Chinese market on the way home.”
SANDRA MARTON 167
“Better get going, then, before the market closes.”
Joaquin nodded, cleaned up his end of the workbench, then
put on his coat. He kissed her cheek and she managed to keep the
tears from building again until the door closed behind him.
Why was she weeping? She’d wanted to end things cleanly.
To keep Alex from contacting her. And she’d succeeded.
She just had to stop crying every five minutes. Sela said itwas
her hormones. It wasn’t. It was her inability to accept that she
would never lie in her lover’s arms again, but she’d sooner have
died than admit that to Sela or even to herself because it wasn’t
true, itwasn’t true, she had awonderful, fulfilling life nowand—
Someone knocked at the loft door.
Maria grabbed the edge of herwork-apron and wiped her eyes.
Had Joaquin forgotten something? Why didn’t he use his key?
Unless it was a reporter. They were still driving her crazy, hoping
for an interview about life on Aristo and the death of its king.
The knock came again. She sighed, smoothed down her apron,
fixed a polite smile to her lips and marched to the door.
“Yes?” No answer. Maria rolled her eyes. “Look, I’ve said I
won’t do interviews so whoever you are—”
“Open the door, Maria.”
Her heart leaped. No. It couldn’t be.
“Maria. Did you hear me? Open this door.”
She shook her head, as if Alex could see her. “Go away,” she
said in a shaky voice.
“I’m not going anywhere. Either you open this door or I’ll
break it down.”
He would, too. He was angry—she could hear it in his voice,
and she remembered what his anger had been like that night he’d
first come here.
Bam! The door, heavy as a chunk of steel, shuddered under
the blow.
“I don’t want to see you.” Maria licked her lips. “Joaquin is
here. He says—”
“He says I’ve been a fool. And he’s right.”
Maria stared at the door. “You talked to Joaquin?”
168 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
“Just now. On the stairs.” Alex’s voice softened; she had to
put her ear to the door to hear him. “He’s been a good friend
to you.You’re lucky to have him to turn to. Maria, glyka mou,
let me in.”
She swallowed hard. Then she undid the bolt and opened the
door.
“I don’t want to talk to you,” she started to say, but the sight
of her Alexandros, so tall, so powerful, so much the lover she remembered,
stole the words away. To her horror, her eyes flooded
with the tears she’d fought only minutes before. She couldn’t let
him see her cry, she couldn’t, she told herself, and she slapped
her hands against the door and started to push it closed.
Alex was too quick. He jammed his shoulder between the
door and its frame and pushed. Maria staggered back, the door
swung open and he stepped into the loft.
He’d had plenty of time to consider how he would handle this
meeting. The flight from Aristo had taken longer than usual. Bad
weather had meant putting down at Charles de Gaulle Airport in
Paris for a few hours. Just as well, he’d thought. The delay had
given him extra time to decide what to say.
He’d come up with a list of questions.A little speech, though
he tried not to call it that, in which he’d let Maria know that a
woman did not simply walk out on him without explanation.
He would be cautious in expressing his feelings, never
mind his mother’s insistence that Maria and he were in love.
The sad truth, as Tia had admitted, was that his mother didn’t
know a damned thing about love. If Maria loved him, why had
she left him?
A woman who loved a man didn’t walk out on him without
so much as a handshake.
He wasn’t so sure about loving her, either. Why would a man
love a woman who’d abandoned him? Who was so independent?
Why would he want her back in his life?
Logical, all of it. The trouble was, the closer he’d come to her
street, the harder his heart had beaten. All his hours of planning
and doubt had dissolved like cotton candy in the rain. And when
SANDRA MARTON 169
he’d bumped into a man on the stairs, he’d known instinctively it
was Joaquin—and known, just as instinctively, that the guy knew
who he was, too, and wanted nothing more than to flatten him.
He could hardly blame him.
Hell, itwas what he’d have done if the situation were reversed.
The men had taken a long look at each other.
“Are you the prince?” Joaquin had finally growled. At Alex’s
nod, the other man’s mouth had thinned. “She loves you, you
jerk. And you don’t deserve her.”
Alex had grinned. Then he’d put his hand out.
“You’re right,” he’d said, and after a few seconds Joaquin had
smiled. They’d shaken hands. Then Joaquin had stepped aside
and Alex had continued up the stairs to Maria’s door when terror
had stopped him cold. Certain of everything, sure of nothing, he
had resorted to anger…
And then he’d come to his senses.
He would do whatever it took to win his Maria’s heart…and,
looking into her eyes, he knew, with a rush of fierce joy, that her
heart had always been his for the taking.
Maria loved him. He loved her. And he’d be damned if he’d
lose her again.
So, in the end, there were no questions, no speeches, no
doubts. There was only a man, baring his soul by stepping
forward and opening his arms to a woman. And—thank you,
God—there was the woman, his Maria, giving a little cry and
throwing herself into his embrace.
He kissed her. Kissed her for a very long time. Her mouth.
Her eyes. Her hair.
“Why did you leave me?” he said.
“Because I have no place in your life,” she said, returning each
kiss, each caress, each sigh.
“I love you. You are my life.”
Her heart soared, but she shook her head. “I can’t be.”
“Do you love me?”
How could she lie to him? How could she deny what burned
in her heart?
170 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
“Yes,” she said softly, “I love you. I adore you, Alexandros.
But I can’t be part of your life. I—I’m not cut out to be a mistress.”
“Of course you aren’t,” Alex said, in that imperious way that
she’d learned to love. “You’re going to marry me and be my wife.”
His words were more precious than any of the diamonds in
the Aristan crown. She knew she would cherish them forever,
even if what he’d just told her could never happen.
“I can’t marry you,” she whispered.
“Because?”
“Because you’re a prince. You have obligations. Duties.”
“I have nothing, unless I have you, glyka mou. You are my
heart. My joy. My love.”
Oh, how easy it would be to give in. To say, ‘Yes, I’ll marry
you…’ But she couldn’t. She loved her Alexandros too much to
ruin his life.
“Alexandros, listen to me.Your father’swords to me were true.”
Alex’s eyes darkened. “What are you talking about?”
“The night he died—Aegeus said—he said I was wrong for
you. That if I loved you, I had to leave you. He said—”
“Was that why he wanted to see you?” Alex’s tone was harsh.
“To tell you to go away?”
“No. Yes. It was more than that. He said he wanted the best
for you.”
“You are the best for me, glyka mou.”
“Also—also, I think he knew something about the diamond.
I think—I think he had something to do with switching the fake
for the real one.”
“I don’t care about that diamond right now,” Alex said fiercely.
“All that matters is us. What we feel for each other, the life we’ll
create together… What?”
Maria was laughing. Or maybe she was crying. He couldn’t
tell; he only knew that something in what he’d just said had
affected her.
And then, he knew.
Slowly, he clasped her shoulders. Held her just far enough
away so he could look at her from head to toe. She looked dif-
SANDRA MARTON 171
172 BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT MISTRESS
ferent. Her face was fuller. So were her breasts. And, under her
denim work-apron, he could see the delicate but clear convexity
of her belly.
It all came together. Her nausea. Her exhaustion. And now,
these physical changes that made her even more beautiful.
“Maria.” He could feel the smile starting to stretch across his
lips. “Maria, my heart, my soul, are you pregnant?”
She stared at him. She could lie. She could say, no, of
course not…
“Yes,” she said softly.
Alex grinned. Then he gathered her in his arms and rained
kisses on her face.
“Pregnant,” he said, as if he were the first man in the world
ever to hear such news. “My God, sweetheart, we’re pregnant!”
He held her inches from him, his eyes searching hers. “Say the
words, Maria. Tell me that you love me as I love you, and that
you will do me the honor of becoming my wife.”
Maria thought of how far they had come, of a time her
Alexandros would have demanded to know if he was really the
father of the baby in her womb. She thought of how he had
crossed the ocean to claim her. She thought of King Aegeus’s
warning, and how cold and empty the life he’d foreseen for his
son now seemed.
“Alexandros,” she said, because if life wasn’t worth risks,
what was the point? “Alexandros. I love you. And it is you who
do me honor, my beloved, by asking me to marry you.”
Alex gave her a solemn look. “Is that,” he said carefully, “a yes?”
Maria laughed, though she was crying again, this time tears
of joy that streamed down her face.
“Yes,” she said, “yes, yes, yes!”
Her Alexandros kissed her. Then he kicked the door shut,
swept her into his arms, and carried her to the bed.

The Kingdom of Adamas: a Turbulent History
The islands of Calista and Aristo have always been a temptation
to world powers. Initially this was because of their excellent positions
for trading and the agricultural potential of Aristo’s
luscious, fertile land. The discovery of diamonds on Calista in
the Middle Ages made the kingdom a target for invaders.
The kingdom passed through the hands of many foreign powers
throughout the ages. Originally part of the ancient Greek empire,
Adamas then came under the control of Rome from 150 BC
onwards. Following the fall of the Roman empire approximately
400 years later, the islands were annexed to Byzantine control.
It was not until Richard the Lionheart seized Adamas in the
twelfth century that the family of Karedes, local island nobility,
was installed on the throne. When the republic of Venice briefly
took control in the fifteenth century, the Karedes dynasty continued
to rule as mere figureheads.
There followed a period of struggle for the royal family. The
Ottoman Empire claimed the islands in the sixteenth century and
they were forced into an exile that lasted nearly 200 years. When
the Turks finally sold the islands to the British in 1750, the royal
family was reinstated but the kingdom did not gain its independence
until 1921.
The death of King Christos in 1974 marked the end of the
kingdom of Adamas. The islands have functioned under separate
rule ever since.
The Stefani Diamond
Diamonds have been prized since the dawn of human history for
their unique qualities. The jewels were first discovered in India
in 800 BC, and brought to Europe by Alexander the Great five
hundred years later.
In 1477, Mary of Burgundy became the first known recipient
of a diamond engagement ring, given to her by the Archduke
Maximilian of Austria. This begins the history and tradition of
diamond engagement rings.
The Koh-i-Noor and the Hope diamonds were brought to
Europe in 1631. In 1792, the Hope Diamond was stolen from the
French crown jewels during the French Revolution. In 1851,
The Koh-i-Noor diamond was re-cut to 105 carats for Queen
Victoria (Empress of India). This famous diamond is part of the
British crown jewels.
In the medieval period, a beautiful pink diamond was discovered
on Calista, and used in the Karedes crown to symbolize the
power of the Karedes’s rule. The jewel became known as the
Stefani (“Crown”) diamond. It quickly took on a deeply symbolic
role in the kingdom of Adamas. Believing that their power
resided in the stone, the Karedes family vowed that it would
never leave their hands. They thought that if the jewel was lost,
their kingdom would fall. The existence of this diamond fueled
treasure hunters’ dreams for centuries, but no other diamond of
any size was found on Calista until the 1940s.
In 1972, faced with increasing tension in his kingdom
between the islands of Aristo and Calista, and with family
pressure, King Christos announced that after his death the two
islands would split. In the presence of his children Anya and
Aegeus, witnessed by the court, Christos declared,
“You will rule each island for the good of the people, and
bring out the best in your kingdom, but my wish is that
eventually these two jewels, like the islands, will be
reunited. Aristo and Calista are more successful, more
beautiful and more powerful as one nation—Adamas.”
After King Christos died in 1974, the Stefani diamond was
split in two to form two stones for the coronation crowns of
Aristo and Calista and fulfill the ancient charter.

Turn the page for our exclusive interview
with Sandra Marton!
We chatted to Sandra Marton about the world of THE ROYAL
HOUSE OF KAREDES. Here are her insights!
Would you prefer to live on Aristo or Calista? What appeals to
you most about either island?
The two islands are both fascinating, but I would much prefer to
live on Aristo. I love the contrast between the sophistication of
Ellos and the wildly beautiful cliffs that wind above the Bay of
Appollonia, the gentle climate, the white sand beaches kissed by
the sea. My husband and I took a wonderful trip to Greece a few
months ago; all the time we were on the island of Santorini, I
kept thinking how easily beautiful Santorini could be Aristo.
What did you enjoy about writing about THE ROYAL HOUSE
OF KAREDES?
I was very fortunate to write the launch book for the series. That
gave me the chance to give substance to Aristo and to the Karedes
family. Breathing life into Aegeus and Tia, the princes and
princesses was great fun. I especially loved creating my hero,
Alexandros. I’ve always thought the lives of royals must be hard,
all that balancing of personal needs with public demands, and here
I had the chance to show some of the inner conflicts that are part
of a royal’s existence. I loved creating Maria, too. Because I was
born and raised in New York, I was able to give her a background
with at least some similarities to mine. Like Maria, I attended its
schools. I went to university there. My first job was in the part of
Manhattan where I put Maria’s loft and, believe me, her feelings
on riding a crowded subway car were a mirror of my own.
How did you find writing as part of a continuity?
It was great fun but also a challenge. I had to be sure to introduce
my secondary characters in ways that wouldn’t be a problem for
the other authors, and to describe places (the palace, for example)
so that the other authors could “see” it as clearly as I did. I’ve
always loved writing my own miniseries because I love the scope
and depth a writer gets from dealing with ongoing characters and
intertwining plots. Writing BILLIONAIRE PRINCE, PREGNANT
MISTRESS gave me that same feeling.
When you are writing, what is your typical day?
Hmm. Let’s see. The maid draws my bath, brings me my morning
coffee… Oh, if only! Seriously, my working day isn’t a glamorous
one. I get up anywhere from six to seven-thirty, shower,
put on what I think of as my summer outfit (shorts, T-shirt, thong
sandals) or my winter garb (jeans, T-shirt, sneakers), head down
to the kitchen where my husband, bless him, is generally already
brewing the coffee. Breakfast is toast and coffee with the
morning news playing in the background. Then I give my
husband a kiss, head for my office, turn on my computer, play a
few rounds of Spider Solitaire—it’s addictive—and settle in to
work. I take a break somewhere between noon and one o’clock.
My husband’s office is upstairs and he comes down and joins me
for lunch. Then it’s back to work until he calls me on the intercom
and reminds me—by then, I’m lost in what I’m writing—that it’s
time for a glass of wine. Depending on my mood, I’ll either put
together an easy meal—not much cooking goes on when I’m
working!—or he’ll grill something on the deck, or we’ll go out
somewhere local for supper. After that, I generally curl up beside
him on the sofa to read, catch the eleven o’clock news, and then
stagger off to bed.
Where do you get your inspiration for the characters that you write?
I’m an inveterate people-watcher. Plop me down in a café in
NewYork or San Francisco, Paris or Athens, and I’m content. I’m
very aware of people’s body language and facial expressions.
Those things communicate a lot to me. Many of my characters
have come to life through my observations of complete strangers
who have no idea I’m taking mental notes! Friends sometimes
think I’ve based my characters on them. I never do. If I know
someone well, I can’t see them as anything but themselves, if that
makes sense.
What did you like most about your hero and heroine in this
continuity?
I love creating Presents heroes, men who are strong and loving, protective
and powerful, and maybe just a little bit arrogant.
Alexandros is all those things. He’s also a man accustomed to not
showing his feelings. I find that, always, a special challenge for a
heroine. And my Maria is, I think, the perfect woman for
Alexandros. She’s independent, spirited and tough in the best
possible meaning of the word. She, too, has learned to keep her
emotions in check. That’s why the passion they discover in each
other’s arms is so exciting. It changes them, forces them to examine
their own true needs, their own true desires. Fate has created Alex
and Maria for each other. For me, that fierce sense of destiny is what
Presents, passion and enduring love are all about.
What would be the best—and worst—thing about being part of
a royal dynasty?
The best would probably be the good one can do as a royal. The
worst would surely be the public exposure demanded of royals.
I tried to convey some of that in Alexandros’s story.
Are diamonds really a girl’s best friend?
It depends on the girl. A serious answer? No, absolutely not.
When you get down to basics, what women—all women—want
is happiness. And happiness comes from much more precious
things than diamonds. Good friends. Good health. A loving
family… Above all, the love of one special man. Those are the
qualities that make a woman’s life full and rich. The glow of
diamonds is lovely but the glow in your lover’s eyes when he sees
you means far, far more.

Censuring the
Inherent Fool:
The
Lost Art
Few would argue that some behavior is so abhorrent, it
demands redressing. Regardless of justification—idiot
drivers, impudent clerks, adolescents who have been
spawn by the devil—we as a society simply cannot condone
smacking the offender upside the head. (Admittedly,
we institute this decision partly in deference to decorum,
but also in the distinct possibility that said transgressor
might be packing heat.) Since throwing the bric-a-brac can
become prohibitively expensive, our only alternative is to
let fly with a few choice words.
That acknowledged, it is miserably apparent that standards
about what is said or heard in public have become
remarkably lax. What comes out of the mouths of babes
nowadays would have once made a fishwife blush. Not that
we deplore vehement notification of character flaws, but

Call Him a Rat;
Just Don’t Call Him a Mouse.
Once, was one to imply a man less than a
gentleman, one would have to meet him
at dawn accompanied by one’s seconds.
The current vogue of anti-heroes
appears to have reversed such a
notion. Calling a man a rogue,
scoundrel, heel or even humping
dog will not necessarily be
an insult. Therefore, with
honor now discounted, the
male character flaws vulnerable
for attack are intellect,
cuckoldry, wimpiness and
penis size.
He is not only dull in himself, but
is the cause of dullness in others.
Samuel Foote
Homo-Boobus
To properly vilify the cabbage-headed oaf, we must, unfortunately,
blaspheme the animal kingdom*—polecat,
skunk, swine, baboon, (particularly effective with a British
inflection) varmint, goose, or donkey. However, if one
calls him a capon (a de-knackered chicken), one has hit a
triple—not only is he a graceless lout, but also a eunuch—
and unless he was in 4H, unlikely to comprehend the slam.

He has no such brain as ear-wax.
Shakespeare
Dullard, dim bulb, dolt, lobberhead, or flap-doodle are
inherent fools. A lurdane or sluggard is not only a fool, but
a lazy fool. The particularly cantankerous ignoramus is a
devil child, demon rogue, archfiend, churl, Mephistopheles,
or carcass fit for dogs. If one wanted to cover all the
8
bases, there is Lusus naturae, which is Latin for freak of
nature. To clarify the subtle difference between a jerk and
a dunce, one must remember not to credit insult that can
be more appropriately explained by stupidity.
cThe Two-timed
Not so very long ago if a man found his wife in bed with
another man and took a shotgun to them both, it was ruled
justifiable homicide. Hence, it might be wise to make certain
there is a clear avenue for escape before one goes
rattling this particular cage. If one does have the moxie
to do it, there is only one way to go. To quote Pulp Fiction,

one has to “get medieval on his ass.” To do so effectively,
one must become intimately familiar with terms as old as
the middle ages.
We begin with the word cuckold, which many believe
originates with the French word for cuckoo bird. This conclusion
is apparently due to that dirty bird’s penchant for
depositing, then abandoning, its monstrous egg into some
unsuspecting little wren’s nest for it to hatch, then attempt
to feed. History has writ cuckoldry a shooting offense, giving
us to understand quite clearly that men do not want another’s
cuckoo baby in their nest. In that the cuckoo egglayer
and proprietress of said nest are both female should

throw a monkey wrench in
this entire affronted manhood
stuff, but as far as we can
determine, it has not.
The derivations of most of
our terms for cheating appear
to be some convolution of the
definition for horn—hard
protuberance, e.g. penis, and
cornu—horn-shaped anatomical
characteristic. Indeed,
there was a mythical beast
called a bicorn, which, legend
says, used to eat husbands
who had unfaithful
wives (as to why these victims
of infidelity were the
ones preyed upon, our crack
team of researchers have
been unable to ascertain).
Then there is the Greek legend of Artemis who caught Actaeon
peeking while she was bathing and turned him into a
stag, thereupon causing his own hounds to eat him—which
maybe served him right.
10
A man does not look
behind the door unless he has
stood there himself.
Du Bois
Hence, the poor cuckold is doomed to suffer, not only his
wife’s infidelity, but being taunted as a cornuto or buck’s
face (has horns, you know), suffering the forked plague,
prey to the bicorn, or, get this, wearing Vulcan’s badge:
The roof of Vulcan, her, by many a gift
Seduced, Mars won, and with adult’rous lust
The bed dishonour’d of the King of fire.
Cowper—The Odyssey of Homer
One must concede that in issuing the jibe, Vulcan’s badge,
it could be misconstrued. A certain element of the population
may not understand that in this context, Vulcan pertains
to the God of Fire and has nothing whatsoever to do
with Star Trek.
A wittol is aware he is being cheated on and puts up with
it (what was Camilla Parker Bowles’ husband’s name anyway?).
If he is aware and enraged, he is horn-mad. If he is
cheating on her, she is a cuckquean and usually The Last
to Know. If the correspondent in this affair is a man, he is,
indeed, Actaeon. His female counterpart is an inconstant,
faithless sore in the side of a man and, no doubt, a wanton
hussy. The entire activity is, quite aptly, named cornucopia
—horn of plenty (we suppose, because there is plenty of
horniness going on).
ATTENTION: It is imperative that when one
inflicts any of the above abuse, it must be done with
extreme superciliousness, else its just not gonna work.

What a candy-ass!
13
carping, cavil, censure, denunciation, disparagement, The Invertebrate
In cockfighting, a white tail feather
among the plumage of a gamecock denotes
inferior breeding and therefore a
less combative rooster. When calling a
person’s courage into question, the accusation
of showing a white feather
may now seem a bit obscure, but for
centuries, it was tantamount to saying
“what a candy-ass.”
In common parlance a cur is a mongrel
dog, but its second definition dating
also from the thirteenth century, is
coward. From the Middle Ages comes
recreant, which as an adjective describes
a begging of mercy (we understand
not an uncommon occurrence
during those times) and by token, one
who does so, a coward.* In the first
half of the 18th century, funk meant
“a state of paralyzing fear,” hence one
who funks is, too, a coward. As to how
and why this term was usurped by the
music industry in the ‘70s remains a
mystery, but it will arbitrarily remove
the word funky from possible cowardly
insults.
*If faced with being drawn and quartered we are
not certain who among us would not go down
screaming like a woman bringing forth child.
He led his regiment
from behind,
He found it less
exciting.
W.S. Gilbert
14
Therefore, the terms that imply the lack of
stalwartness of someone’s innards are: lilylivered,
yellow-bellied, spineless, faint, or
chicken-hearted, pantywaist, or a gutless
wonder. One might avoid wimp and big
baby—they lack imagination. Woody Allen
says he is not a hypochondriac, but an
alarmist. That makes our list, as does
milquetoast, caitiff, craven, dastard, or
poltroon. Save sissy-britches or wienie for
when one has to pull out the big artillery.
VFYI: We note a rectal sub-category
as it relates to the frightened. First, there is the
pucker factor, which refers to the degree of fear that
causes one’s sphincter to tighten. Contrarily is the
green heron or shitepoke which, when startled into
flight, defecates. It goes without saying that whatever
category one may find oneself in when, say, one’s aircraft
plummets or the IRS makes inquiries, should remain
between oneself and one’s laundress.
He Who Is Not Nick-Named Tripod
There was an old man named Ringer,
Who was seducing a beautiful singer.
He said with a grin,
“Now, I’ve got it in.”
Said she, “You mean that’s not your finger?”
Cowardice is distinguished from panic by
the inability to suspend the imagination.
Of the euphemisms we uncovered for a man less favored
by nature (hung like a chicken, pencil-dick and bugfucker),
we can only recommend under-endowed and
three-inch fool, so this entry will be blessedly small (no
pun intended).
The Five-Letter Womanr
:
She was a woman of mean understanding,
Little information and uncertain temper.
Jane Austen
Historically the most effective means to rebuke any woman
was to disparage her virtue (that or possibly her fashion
sense). Nowadays, un-virtuous and unladylike are probably
as useless as insults go as un-gentlemanly. Yet however
ubiquitous its use, we can agree that calling a disreputable
female a bitch (or even puppy’s mama) is not only
common, but an insult to female dogs. Harpy,
harridan, slattern, or shrew may be vintage, but
they are just pithy enough for general reproach
of shrill, hateful behavior. When faced with an
irredeemably cantankerous woman,
she may well be the Devil’s Sister.
(If she appears to find this in any way
complimentary, a keen sense of self
preservation might suggest one run
like a cheap pair of pantyhose.)

rFoul Sluts
Even if the succubus
that one’s brother intends
to marry is a fornicatress
that has seen
more pricks than a
dartboard, we encourage
one not to refer to
her as a slut, tramp,
hussy, trollop, roundheeled
floozy, or dirtylegged
Jezebel. One
might get away with
“she’s been around the
block more times than
the Good Humor man”
to others, but unless he
actually asks your opinion,
one might do well
to refrain from comment
at all.
Other analogies for that

or any noun that can

be ridden: bicycle, hobby horse, barber’s chair, ferry,
hackney, taxi, etc. A badger is a loose woman who is particularly
ill-scented.
Disclaimer: This information is offered only for elucidative
purposes.
VFYI: If one believes that a woman is of accommodating
morals and decides to say so publicly, one has
bewhored her (or, depending on one’s ‘hood, possibly
beho-ed her). Be certain that she doesn’t mind
the advertisement or have your affairs in order, for it
is said: “Hell hath no fury like pussy with a pistol.”
Dog City
If while mentally cruising some parallel
universe, one believes it a good
idea to slander a masculine woman,
at least have the good sense to avoid
calling her a diesel-dyke or hell pig.
Virago, beldame, trolleymog, daggletail,
or buffarilla mean precisely
the same thing and their relative obscurity
may offer one just enough
time to elude being beaten to a pulp.
VNOTE: We have been told
that if one is in a Spanish-speaking
country, it is also advisable not to
compliment a strong woman by
calling her macha.

Sacre Bleu:
Profanities and
Expletives
w
The “F” ing Word & Other Intensives
Veritable, sure enough, or bona-fide are perfectly respectable
intensifiers when one needs, well, emphasis. Unfortunately,
fucking seems to be the hands-down pejorative of
choice in modern society. This being the case, we believe a
little historical perspective couldn’t hurt . . .
No matter how many people believe it true, it is highly unlikely
that the word “fuck” is an acronym of For Unlawful
Carnal Knowledge or that other old chestnut, Fornicate
Under Consent of the King. Eric Partridge believed it
evolved from the German word ficken for “to strike.” Like
most, he found the word objectionable. He, however, categorized
it along with words that he considered sadistic representations
of the male’s part in copulation: clap, strike,
thump, nail, and, yes, bang.Webster’s offers the derivations,
fokken (Dutch, to breed) or fokka (Swedish, to copulate).
Others suggest the French word foutre, to thrust, and even
firk (English 1600’s), to beat or to lash. However it originated,
it has been in use and considered a vulgarity the better
part of a millennium. As an intensive, Webster’s calls it
meaningless. There are those who would disagree.
To avoid inciting an affronted swoon
by the more sensitive souls of society,
acronyms have been embraced in place
of a number of phrases that include
the “f” word. Specifically, we have
GFY, which instructs one to do something
anatomically impossible (Go
Fuck Yourself ); GFU, a moron (General
Fuck-Up); and NFW, an implausibility
(No Fucking Way). Related
acronyms include SNAFU, a cynical
expectation of any situation in which
the military is involved (Situation
Normal, All Fucked-Up); FUBAR,
unrecognizably mussed (Fucked-Up
Beyond All Recognition); and there is
the sarcastic BFD (Big Fucking Deal).
Additionally, when one has been indisputably wronged, one
has been RF—Royally Fucked (also known as the king’s
elevator—the royal shaft). Just for the record, a flying
fuck is what one does not give, not airborne copulation.
And abso-fucking-lutely means beyond a shadow of a
doubt.
22
w
Merde
The four-letter word for defecation has been in use for
eons—which allows that antiquity does not necessarily dictate
grand lexicon. It is possible to avoid the vulgarity of
the word shit completely, as feces, manure, and dung all
mean the same thing. (Small point of interest: feces refer to
human waste, manure and dung, animal.) Other selections
tend to be polysyllabic but are colorful—meadow dressing,
bovine excrement, horse apples, corral confetti, etc.
Granted, if one is discussing political matters, it may be impossible
to avoid using (or even shouting) bullshit. However,
if one does not want to compromise decorum completely,
that can be shortened to B.S. Or, call it hogwash,
heifer dust, or lip-gloss. Bull-chips might do in a pinch
but, in all probability, not what pops out of one’s mouth
when faced with ultimate doom (at which time one will
most likely be up Shit Creek). Indeed, sources report that
when the black boxes are recovered from airplane crash
sites, invariably the last words on the tape are “Uh-oh,”
“Fuck!” and “Oh, shit. ”
Of course, one can use the French, merde or
speak of “a short French expletive” which
would in fact allow one to perform a rather impressive
circumlocutory hat trick, a euphemism
for a euphemism for euphemism.
When one finds it necessary to point out the
limitations of another’s character via the
23
cavil, censure, denunciation, disparagement, reproach,
alimentary canal, it is our position that it is preferable to
enlist mock Latin such as excrementum cerebellum vincit
rather than call someone a shit-head.
Other expressions that would benefit such translation are:
shit list (a mental note of personae non gratae); the shitty
end of the stick (the bad end of a bargain—often known
as the shaft); to shit or get off the pot (or fish or cut bait).
To shit in high cotton is to have attained a higher standard
of living. But not knowing shit from Shinola—well, that
means . . . owing to stupidity one cannot tell feces from
shoe polish. Someone whose continued presence is an
24
annoyance sticks like shit to a shovel. Alternatively,
shit on wheels reflects an over-inflated opinion of oneself.
(We, however, could in no way determine how one could
deign this to be a self-compliment).
Shit a brick technically means discharging a copious and
compacted bowel movement, but colloquially it refers to
accomplishing the impossible. Lastly, to be so angry as to
perform said impossibility is engaging in a shit-fit (also
known as pitching a bitch). Certainly there are Latin
instructors standing by to assist us.
w Vexed
As ancient a word as is piss, it was not until the last century
that humankind found use for it beyond the single
verb or noun. Nowadays, if one is pissed off, one is actually
choleric (and undoubtedly with one’s panties in
a bunch or knickers in a knot). Shakespeare expressed
it thusly: “You do me the most insupportable vexation.”
Other urinary-based euphemisms and their more civilized
translations: full of piss and vinegar (effervescent), piss
away (squander the inheritance—leaving oneself without a
pot to piss in), and piss blood (work with extreme diligence).
A piss-ass is a worthless individual (occasionally called an
arseworm), to engage in a pissing match is an endeavor
that is certain to be unproductive, and if one is piss-poor,
one is monetarily disadvantaged (e.g., without cable).
25
cavil, censure, denunciation, disparagement, reproach,
26
Full a’ piss and
vinegar, ye’ are!
Piss ugly is extremely unattractive
and if piss-faced, one
is overly medicated by alcohol.
The heretofore unheard of, pissed as
a newt has come to our attention. As we
have not personally been confronted by an
outraged salamander, we are uncertain of the
etymology or history of this term. We can only
labor under the supposition that in this situation,
“pissed” does mean vexed, for we believe one even less
likely to come across a drunken newt than a mean one.
VNOTE: The colorful late U. S. Vice President, John
Nance Garner is oft quoted as saying the office of Vice
President was not worth a bucket of warm spit. Those who
knew the man insist he didn’t use the word, “spit.”

TheAbodeof theWickedDead
Down, down to hell;
and say I sent thee thither
Shakespeare
Technically hell is the nether realm of
the devil in which the damned suffer
everlasting punishment. In other words, a real sticky
wicket. The word in and of itself is not naughty. Nevertheless,
everyone knows (or at least suspects) that damning
someone to it is considered a blasphemy.
Hence, it is not surprising that an entire cottage industry
of euphemistic splendor has erupted from that word’s
roots. Indeed, the lengths to which people go to say it without
“saying it” is quite remarkable: Hades, Hail Columbia,
blue blazes, Cain, tarnation, Sam Hill, Kingdom Come,
You Know Where, or any place that implies “down there,”
the hot place, netherworld, lower regions, etc. Although
28
the Victorians gave us heck, perdition has been a suitable
alternative since the 14th century. Today we seldom hear
the once popular Go to Helen B. Happy. A shame, really.
Hellacious is a multi-purpose adjective that can mean either:
exceptionally powerful, remarkably good, extremely
difficult or extraordinarily large. To be hell-bent is
recklessly determined come hell or high water.
w
Doggone and Up Yours
Oh darn, dang, confound, consarn, dagnab, dash, blank,
or blast followed by it, are all euphemistic replacements for
the word, damn. All denounce someone or something as
evil. Truly genteel society frowns on these seemingly benign
adjectives as well as bloody, bleeding,
blamed, all-fired, dad-gummed, dratted,
and cotton-picking.
At one time, a curse was serious business.
No one took lightly being consigned
by another to hell, which may
be why Go to the Devil morphed
into Kiss My Ass. Go jump in the
lake or take a long walk off a short
pier are only nicer sounding ways to
tell someone to fold it five ways and
shove it where the sun don’t shine.

Silent Disparagement
(The Bird and His
Friends)
Although many think of it as contemporary,
digitus infamis or digitus impudicus (infamous
or indecent finger) as a phallic symbol has
been referenced in literary works as early as
ancient Rome. Mad-as-a-hatter Caligula was
rumored to hold up his middle finger for supplicants
to kiss.
There is the obvious suggestion of genitalia
in fist and extended middle finger, but we
have heard that during early warfare, captured
enemy archers had their fingers removed so they
couldn’t draw a bow. Therefore, holding up two fingers
(index and middle) backwards to one’s enemy signified
one could still do them damage. One could premise
that’s pretty much saying “f--- you.”
From the fight scene in Romeo & Juliet, which
commenced with the snapping of thumbnail under
the front teeth, to Texas A&M’s upraised “Gig ‘Em
Aggies” thumb, we see the ultimate insult can be insinuated
by other than extended middle finger. In the Arab world,
palm down, middle finger waggling downward means the
same as raised middle finger in the West.
31
censure, denunciation, disparagement, reproach,oppro-
VFYI: The little finger offered as
suggestion of a, shall we say, modestly
proportioned male part is not of modern
origin. Seek ye the Bible. I Kings 12:10.
32
To express general disrespect, there is the Cock a Snook,
also known as Ann’s Fan or Pulling Bacon, which is the
thumb on nose, fingers waving. To grasp one elbow and
raise a fist is one of the commonest insult
found worldwide, but is not universal.
That title must go to displaying
one’s naked backside. Anthropologists
say mooning predates Braveheart and,
loosely translated, meant “eat shit.”
After the fall of Bagdad, we saw Iraqis
beating the tar out of portraits and statues
of Saddam Hussein with their
shoes, revealing to westerners one of the strongest insults
of their culture—that of sticking the sole of your shoe in
someone’s face.
As there are any number of variations of armpit, bicep, fist,
finger, thumb, nose, crotch and spit . . . maneuvers to express
disrespect in different cultures, if one must hail a cab,
say, in Greece or New York, do so with all due caution.
Circumlocution
Because we often toss them about willy-nilly, we may forget
that euphemisms serve a greater purpose than merely
keeping the ladies at a garden party from glaring at us over
the top of their spectacles. A glib turn of phrase can spare
wounded feelings, a few mincing words keep lawyers at bay.
Until the Victorian era, however, the euphemistic mother
lode had not really begun to be mined. Once Queen Victoria
was on her throne and her minions on high alert, there
was little that couldn’t be accused of having a sexual, and
therefore, evil, connotation. Everything had to be renamed.
Hence, a bull became a cow’s spouse and one’s buttocks,
sit-upons. One can only imagine how dicey it must have
been sitting down at Sunday dinner for some poor soul
trying to ask for a specific piece of chicken.
w
A Woman of Expansive Sensibilities
Paphos was an ancient city of Cypress known for worshipping
Aphrodite. The well-traveled, or at least well-read,
33
Victorian men found it quite sly to call a prostitute or her
doings, Paphian. Further 19th century circumlocution favored
demimondaine, academician, abbess, courtesan,
Fille de jolie (fun gal) or nymph du pave (streetwalker). The
term of choice for those whose professions or predilections
sought to save her soul: she was a fallen woman.
One rarely hears of a lady of certain description or
painted woman anymore, but one would have to be pretty
obtuse not to understand the meaning. A little more recent
is woman of the night, streetwalker, naughty girl, and
commercial sex worker. A quick check of our Yellow Pages
did not uncover services by call girls. However, escort,
model, and actress listings are numerous and offer “discreet
billing.”
As for the specific establishment where these shenanigans
take place, a century ago it was referred to as a leaping
academy, vaulting school, disorderly house, knocking
shop, or chamber of commerce. However dated that
sounds, one must agree that today’s snake ranch or slut
hut is not much of an improvement. Granted, whorehouse
is to the point, but just a tad crude. If compelled to speak
of it, polite society might say it is a brothel, place of accommodation,
bagnio, or seraglio. Or, depending on your
frame of mind, house of ill-repute.
Furthering the subject, we proffer that he who pimps prostitutes
is not a pussy peddler, hole-toller, buttock broker,
vent renter, or crack salesman, but a panderer, procurer,
or the French, sounteneur, and with or without pimpmobile,
undoubtedly, a louse (editorially speaking).

As lechery appears to be an

Nowadays, he who pursues
such activities with undue

little stud muffin has seen more
tail than a toilet seat, when the

he may be described as of
distempered blood and duteous

at Oxford.)
We can call him a debaucher,
libertine, flesh-monger, incubus,
Lothario, insatiate, or roué,
but it doesn’t make him any less

At one time, to question a

matter. Such was its consequence;
one dare not bandy

the more innocent prevaricator
was often accused
of only spinning a windy or

Although not technically lying, pettifoggery fits into this

In English colleges such as Oxford, the aristocrats wore
special tassels (tufts) on their mortarboard hats to denote
their status. The more obsequious among the student body
sought them out, ergo—tuft-hunters. To most, these truly
annoying suck-ups are sycophants.
If overtaken by an undeniable need to
publicly decry this character flaw, one
might whip out one’s French dictionary
and sniff “leche-cul” (butt-kisser) right in
the servile flatterer’s face. Once out of high
school, however, it is advisable to sling
more derogatory comments such as
bootlicker and brown-noser behind the
back. If you do cast this particular stone,
understand that bootlicker is associated
with the habit of kissing the feet of kings
and therefore conveys a modicum of respectability (only
barely). However, it is often overlooked that brown-noser
refers to the result of smooching another part of the anatomy.

In the Altogether
By definition, if one finds oneself in dishabille, one is carelessly
attired. In truth, that French term is often nothing
less than an outright accusation of misconduct. Not only
has one been cited for having one’s clothes in a muss, but
also by having them become that way because one has
been fooling around. Standard advice: Gather whatever
dignity one is able to muster, deny everything and make
a brisk exit.
If caught without a stitch in the great outdoors, one is au
natural. If indoors and can strike a pose, one is nude. In
the case of being stark-ballock-naked and in a compromising
situation, one is nekkid.* No defense—beat a hasty retreat
without the bugle call.

It is never necessary to use that three-letter word regardless

is just too simple and one feels the need to express oneself
more floridly, we suggest posterior, derriere, ampersand,
parts behind, prat (hence, pratfall), differential, fanny,
fleshy part of the thigh, blind cheeks, bum, or tushy.

Webster’s first definition for bibulous is “highly absorbent,”

In Elizabethan time, the place of ease was known as a jakes,
this was eventually corrupted to ajax. Derivation of another
more oft used term for the facilities, the loo remains under
disagreement. Some like l’eau (French for water), others
insist it lieu (as in “place”). Nonetheless, euphemisms for
the room that contains a toilet can fall into two categories.
In the first, based on the concept of contrary connotation,
we have bank, chapel, coffee shop, commons, counting
house, cottage, library, office, parliament, Spice Island,
or the temple.
The less verbally discriminating, however, relieve themselves
in a bog, cacatorium, can, compost hole, dilberry
creek, dunny, forakers, john, necessarian, place where
one coughs, siege-house, or stool of ease. In most places
in Europe, one seeks the W.C. (water closet), which seems
infinitely more reasonable than in America’s restroom
(where one may sit but does not necessarily rest).
VFYI: Yes, the story is apparently true, there actually
was a Thomas Crapper who invented a flush toilet.
w Wring Out One’s Socks
Our study has revealed a vast disparity
between the number of euphemisms for
male urination (lots) compared to those
for female (zilch). This may well fall to
the unquestionably finer sensibilities prevalent amongst the
lady-folk. Either that or if one sits to release one’s bladder,
it is a solitary, quiet event. There is very little associated
activity once one has made certain the toilet seat is down.
But he who has a penis with which to pee can even write
his name in the snow—well, for argument’s sake, we suppose
a woman could do it, but it would take a while.
Men can also take the snake for a gallop, siphon the
python, shake hands with the bishop, point Percy at the
porcelain, or train Terrance on the terracotta after which
they can shake the dew off the lily.
Either sex could give the Chinaman a music lesson, but in
that few use china pots in which to tinkle anymore, it is
generally obsolete.
As an exit excuse to relieve themselves, men go water the
horses, feed the goldfish, see how high the moon is, kill a
snake, chase a rabbit, drain the radiator, or check the ski
rack.Women seem to just go to the “Ladies” to powder
their noses (albeit a bit nonsensically, in pairs).

Are there any grander occasions to pull out all the stops,
euphemistically speaking, than speculating on just where
the dearly departed’s place of eternal rest will be? The

triumphant, called to a higher service, or, less optimistically,
stoking Lucifer’s fires. Non-ecumenically, a quietus

Overborne by Desire
Few, if any, still believe that only the male gender suffers
from the pangs of lust. If proof be needed, the phenomena
of Valentino, Elvis and Chippendale’s dancers provide full
support for the theory that sexual appetence is an equal
opportunity employer. Yet, regardless how prevalent its
use, we again point out that the word horny, via horn,
comes from a root word pertaining to the erect penis.
Therefore, for absolute accuracy, a woman may be just as
lustful, dissolute, concupiscent, lascivious, libidinous,
salacious, appetent, licentious, ribald, prurient, wanton,
or humpy as a man, but, unless born a hermaphrodite, or
completed gender reassignment, she will not be horny.
Those terms describing the throes of excess cupidity can
be gender specific and—however we wish they not—the
examples that come to mind for men are pussy simple,
cunt-struck and betwattled. Although a woman may have
75
hot pants or be cocksmitten, we prefer to say either is
confounded by love (more likely confounded by lust, but
it is not our place to proselytize). The unmistakable (and
most conspicuous) concomitant of desire, however, is
borne by the male: Penis in erectus.
F Temporary Priapism
Although it might initially sound like a Viagra high, a
priapism (named after Priapus, a Greek and Roman god
of male generative power) is a medical condition that manifests
itself by an unrelenting erection which is quite painful
76
A stiff prick has
no conscience.
Ancient Proverb
and—here’s the catch—is unrelieved by sexual gratification.
We will remark only upon the temporary kind.
Unlikely as it is to be referenced in one of Martha Stewart’s
fine books, for procreative (or recreational) purposes
everyone will agree that an erection is A Good Thing.
However, if the little devil rears its head when copulation
is merely on the mind but not imminent, it might prompt
some explaining—something we did not find indexed by
Miss Manners either.
If a rise in one’s Levi’s is espied by someone peripheral to
the action, we advise the male in question to adopt an air of
innocence and complain of an involuntary biological reaction.
Genital tumescence, virile reflex, and male arousal
are equally non-accusatory terms. All are preferable to hat
rack, blue-veiner, clothes prop, tent peg, live rabbit,
proud meat, horn colic, bit of a stiff, or sporting some
wood—even if one is ready to dig post holes with it.
VNOTE: Many men consider an inadvertent hard-on
(an expression we do not endorse) as an unwitting condition
and maintain, therefore, that they should not be held
accountable for that over which they hold no control (see
The Unruly Member).
Certainly beyond one’s sway is morning pride, which, for
exonerative purposes, can be identified as matutinal erection.
Indeed, if the male can convey an appropriately
sleepy-headed look, this excuse is good until noon. If one’s
nocturnal erection is inexplicably relieved during the
night, one has shot the bishop.

Another actual affliction is erethism, an abnormal irritability
or responsiveness to stimulation. Erethism (it too comes
from Greek, but we did not find any reference to the god of
crankiness) is an actual disorder, which does give marginal
credibility to the otherwise questionable assertion by some
men that for arousal they need no more inducement than a
stiff breeze. One could propose either of these ailments as
reason for undue . . . excitement, but both are a bit obscure.
We suggest one assert oneself as constitutionally inclined
to passion. It sounds a bit Edwardian, but far better
than randy as a goat.
Beware: If one needs to call upon this explanation
while wearing nothing more than a trench coat, it is
probable the police will look upon one’s suffering
unsympathetically. The docket sheet will read lewd
conduct, however, not weenie-wagger.

The Long Carbine
Whether one is endowed with a howitzer or peashooter,
guns are, and always have been, phallic symbols.
In the 17th century, flintlock guns had a hammer, a flint to
produce a spark, a lockpan that held the priming powder
and a main charge behind the
musket ball. When the hammer
was released, it hit a small flint
rock igniting a spark that lit the
priming powder, and if all went
as planned, then exploded the
main charge. Sometimes this prehigh-
tech procedure backfired
and the priming powder flashed
but did not ignite the main charge.
Hence a flash in the pan, but no
shot was produced. If one had
game (or the enemy) in one’s
sights but needed time to aim,
the hammer could be partially
cocked. If the gun fired while
in this position, it went off halfcocked—
no doubt a quite vexing
and dangerous occurrence.

manhood, manliness, masculinity, fornication, generation, sexuality,
We recount all of this seeming arcane information only to
provide background to fully understand the following:
If one achieves an erection but one’s intention is thwarted by
a premature ejaculation, one has gone off half-cocked, fired
in the air, shot in the bush, misfired, or has experienced
a flash in the pan. Hanging fire occurs when the priming
powder initially failed to ignite the main charge. This term
has come to be synonymous with indecision, not as some insist,
a lengthy orgasm. These expressions have been bandied
about for both sexual and non-sexual purposes for centuries.
When we study their origins, they do make perfect sense.

As much as it sounds as if it should be, we all know to
peter-out is not necessarily a sexual innuendo. In fact, the
dictionary definitions for peter are as follows: (1) to diminish,
(2) to become exhausted, (3) a vulgar name for one’s
penis, and (4) one of the twelve apostles. (Insomuch as
one’s penis (3) diminishes (1) when it becomes exhausted
(2), we will conclude that other than that the Apostle Peter
(4) must have had one, he is irrelevant to this discussion).
The French word pete means to explode weakly (also an
expulsion of intestinal gas). Peter dans la main means literally,
to come to nothing. The Dictionary of Word Origins says
that peter-out originated with miners in the mid-1800’s (an
explanation of which, trust us, is even less relevant than
the Apostle Peter). Regardless, what we do know is that to
peter-out means to give out—be spent—and usually not
with a bang (so to speak). Lest one’s lover be unconsoled,
we suggest it is time to explore The French Arts.

R We Are Not Amused
In Victorian times, illicit love referred to sexual shenanigans
between anyone outside of holy wedlock. So heinous
was such activity, it was called criminal conversation (a
more stupefyingly cryptic euphemism we have yet to behold).
If it became necessary to allude to such foul doings
in print, even so ambiguous a term as criminal conversation
was far too explicit. It was abbreviated as crim. con.
or even c.c., a ruse that was not particularly effective.
Sociologists explain
that sexual shenanigans
inside holy wedlock
were frowned on as
well, but we understand
that authorities
were seldom able to
actually make arrests
for it.
H Wreak One’s Passion
If our ancestors’ sensibilities in print were euphemized into
total obscurity, private conversations were not held to the
same standard. We note that the designation for the act of
c.c. was then, as now, often preceded
by an acquiring verb: getting,
having, copping, grabbing, nabbing,
snatching, fetching, wanting,
and occasionally, begging for any
noun used to specify the female pudendum.
Typical of these nouns are
cookie, nooky, ass, beaver, bird,
jam, pork, bob, snug, box, bull’s
eye, buns, booty, cat, pussy, crack,
cranny, crotch, down, flesh, hole,
fur-pie, honey-pot, kitty, lap, milk,
monkey, mouse, muff, naughty,
oyster, poontang, rump, squirrel,
twat, twittle, and you-know-what
(often times further identified adjectively
as a bit of). All are, even
now, substituted for the detested
“c” word.*

*Although it has been in use since the
14th century, we offer less sensibility stunning
euphemisms for the monosyllable
under the heading The Little Man and
His Boat.
On occasion, this vast array of monosyllabic choices causes
an exceedingly aroused male to abandon assigning what he
wants a specific name. He may eliminate the use of a noun
altogether and just says some (get some, want some, etc).
However brainless this sounds, we have to give credit here.
Although man is an unwitting party, Webster’s does define
the word some as “being an unknown, undetermined, or unspecified
unit or thing.” This suggests that when in rut, the
male of the species does not like to restrict his possibilities.
p To Spend
If referring to the male orgasm, shot his wad, blown off,
spooged, or popped his nuts are unnecessary. He has experienced
sexual reflex. He can also have eventuation,
emissio seminis, or effect emission
(although we admit the latter does
sound a bit like a NASA instruction).
For women, making the chimney
smoke seems not overly graphic, but
again, we prefer the French, petit
mort meaning little death. Come,
spend, and get off do refer to orgasm
for both sexes, but then, so does
climax.

That which is ejaculated, is just that, ejaculate. Baby batter,
duck butter, man oil, bull gravy, gism, guma glue, buttermilk,
and love juice are a bit too . . . icky.We prefer it called
semen, reproductive fluid, or even sexual discharge.
Leukorrhea is the whitish viscid discharge from the vagina
known more delicately as fleurs blanches or white flowers.
(In the 19th century, wags said this condition was occasioned
by young ladies who read overly explicit French
novels.) Those less discerning call it the twitters. Only the
outright crude would pronounce her dripping for it. Under
the heading of untoward
euphemisms,
we find snail trails
(the resultant traces
of vaginal secretion
on a woman’s leg) and
pecker tracks (dribbles
of semen on trousers—
or, occasionally, a blue
dress).

is a fellatrice.

cigarette. In the 1800’s, it also meant to work hard
or become exhausted (by having to cut all that fire
wood?). Its contemporary connotation possibly stems
from its use to describe the tradition of young English
boarding school boys who act as a servant to older
students. The rumors about what actually occurs in

fanned the fires of this particular vulgarism.

A hundred years ago the learned did not call pornography

for sexual excitement. Those who revel in such activity are
indelicately referred to as fecal-freaks, kitchen cleaners,
and felch queens. To felch means to perform anilingus*
(tookus-lingus to our less somber fellow beings). A pound
cake-queen enjoys being defecated on. Anyone engaged in
this base pastime (beyond the age of two) is taking part in
a Boston Tea Party. An associated activity, golden showers,

If a man is sexually aroused and then brought to satisfaction
by manual manipulation of his member by another, he
has been brought down by hand, a more circumspect term
for a hand-job, spitting white, or upshot. (The person
who supplied the hand is a peter-beater who caught an
oyster otherwise known as “sweetheart.”)
No Glove—No Love
It has been some time since one would hear of a condom
wearer as fighting in armor. So ancient is the term, it very
nearly predates the invention of circular protection itself.
It may surprise some to know that condoms were in use as
early as Elizabethan times although they did not become
common (and then only in the large cities) until two centuries
later.
These early sheaths were often made of material such as
sheepskin (ouch), fish bladder (yuck) and eventually, rubber.
Indeed, Casanova is said to have bragged of owning a
pretty little linen ditty (un petit linges) with a delicate drawstring
ribbon—the upper class does have its privileges.
Some of these early protectors were said to bear the portraits
of famous persons—the significance of which does
not immediately leap to mind. Perhaps a modern equivalent
is a lunch box bearing the image of Mighty Morphin’
Power Rangers—but we suppose we digress.
Once these handy little devices were perfected, euphemisms
did abound—keeping down the census, taking a dry run,
or wearing a cheater.Wearing a fearnought, lace curtain,
diving suit, head gasket, nightcap, catcher’s mitt, rubber
cookie, overcoat, raincoat, saddle, shower cap, lifepreserver,
washer, party hat, Dutch cap, phallic thimble,
or, less preferably, a cum drum could reference either a
condom, or a diaphragm. A pussy butterfly is an intrauterine
device or IUD.
Most commonly, however, a protective sheath has been
called, variously, a French, Italian, Spanish, or American
letter. (We did not find indication that it has been called an
English letter. Hmmm.)
Malthus was an English curate. The Maltusian
Theory posits that population tends to increase
geometrically and resources or means of subsistence,
arithmetically. Hard-liners believed that
unless procreation was checked by moral restraint
or even disaster (pestilence, famine, or
war) unrelenting poverty and its resultant human
degradation would inevitably result. This doctrine
is often cited as an excuse for the use of
birth control, hence, labeling any non-procreant
sex, Malthusian.

Sex a Cappella
The rhythm method may indeed be chancy, but it is still a

bareback means intercourse without protection. On
occasion, condom-less sex is called making faces in that it
often leads to producing babies.
VFYI: As the male anatomy is limited in its ability

enough as to enjoy what is called a triple header, a

The word bastard was once solely a comment on one’s

French, fils de bast or packsaddle child.Born on the wrong
side of the blanket (the foul event producing said infant
taking place other than within the marriage bed) or born
in the vestry (left on the church steps) were other roundabout
ways of disparaging one’s heritage. Also, a counterfeit,
wood colt, stall whimper, nullius filius, or side-slip

Unknown to Man
In historical romance novels, a virgin (depending on the
genre) was either picked, plucked, ruined, trimmed,
deflowered, or devirginated. When a sweet young thing
succumbed to seduction, she was persuaded to venery.
Until then she was a chaste treasure, virgin patent, or
rosebud, possibly remaining that way by wearing iron
knickers. Digital investigation of the vagina comes under
the heading of heavy petting. For
anyone in need of exact terminology—
in legalese, carnal knowledge
is the slightest penetration of the
vulva. If one is messing with jailbait,
one is looking at jail time.
Even if she spends more time on
her knees than a priest, she is still
technically a virgin—a demi-vierge—
never having gone all the way.
Indeed, if the results of recently
published, if somewhat unscientific, polls are to believed,
by today’s standards, a fellatio generating enough suction
to suck a golf ball through a garden hose would not be
considered a sex act. We believe this is now known as
The Clinton Exculpation.

Trafficking
with Oneself
95% of people masturbate.
The other 5% just lie about it.
If there are no obliging friends about and one does not care
to avail oneself of commercial outlets (brothels), genital
stimulation via phallengetic motion may be the only alternative
for one’s sexual . . . disposal. Still condemned by
many, the solitary vice has managed not only to survive,
but flourish, even under the threat of blindness, insanity,
hairy palms and your mother’s (and the Church’s) wrath.

Many believe masturbation is synonymous with Onanism.
In the Bible, however, Onan’s sin, scholars insist, was not
coitus, copulation, fornication, generation, intimacy, lovemaking,magn
115
masturbation at all but coitus interruptus. (Regardless, he
was slain by God for this heinous sin and let that be a lesson
to us all.) This misunderstanding may well have been a
deliberate Victorian manipulation of the scriptures laying
the groundwork for generations of adolescent guilt-trips.
Additionally, as Onan was a guy, these guilt-trips were
taken primarily by young men. The Victorian rationale
was that all womankind (wives, daughters, mothers—i.e.
any female a Victorian man was not trying to seduce) were
chaste of mind and body. Indeed, most doctors of the era
persisted with the fallacy that ladies were devoid of sexual
desire; therefore, the possibility of these women having an
orgasm with or without the aid of a penis did not exist.
Hence, it is the masculine population whose indiscriminate
nocturnal . . . twiddling came under intense scrutiny and
abject condemnation. So strong was the shame, we still
hear self-pleasuring condemned as genital pollution, selfabuse,
and the sin of youth.
Wanking may be the more oft-used term, but for those
formal occasions, digitally oscillating one’s penis or selfinduced
penile regurgitation would be preferable. In
French, se branler, se crosser, se faire les cinq doigts de la
main, se passer un poignet, or la veuve poignet (branler—to
shake, crosser—to club, faire—perform, cinq doigts—five
fingers, passer—happen, poignet—wrist, veuve—widow—
you do the math.) If merely fiddling with the equipment,
one is playing pocket pool.
As the dogma surrounding this abhorrent act is so intense
and the deed is fraught with such euphemistic eloquence, it
is an absolute necessity to be generous in recounting them.

Master of One’s Domain (a term “Seinfeld” did not invent)
can be succinctly defined. For every shaming euphemism,
we find dozens that are unrepentant (and if not actually
poetry, one can appreciate the rhyme): bleed the weed,
bang your wang, shake the snake, ram the ham, rope the
Pope, spank the frank, squeeze the cheese, stroke the
bloke, crank one’s whank, flog the log, lube the tube,
wanker the anchor, hone the cone, strain the vein, pump
the stump, torque the fork, thump the pump, tickle the
pickle, jerkin’ the gherkin, yank your plank, tease the
weasel, fist your mister, punchin’ the munchkin and
make the scene with a magazine.
Some are, if not poetic, at least alliterative: burp the baby,
cuddle the Kielbasa, fondle the fig, punish Percy in the
palm, smash the stake, hug the hog, stir one’s stew,
strangle the stogie, slap pappy, bash, beat, or bop the
bishop, pummel the priest, wave the wand, whip one’s
copulation, fornication, generat ion, intimacy, lovemaking, magnetis m,
wire, paddle the pickle, bang the banjo, dash one’s
doodle, grip the gorilla, and prime one’s pump.
There are dated euphemisms—get the German soldiers
marching, have a date with Rosy Palms, polish one’s
helmet, phone the czar, take Herman to the circus, feed
the ducks, clean one’s rifle, give a one gun salute, and
choke the sheriff and wait for the posse to come; and
contemporary—adjust your set, go on Pee Wee’s little
adventure, boot up the hard drive, paint a small Jackson
Pollock, stretch the turtleneck, play the single-string
air guitar, feed the Kleenex, tweak your twinkie, do
the Han Solo, romance the bone, choke Kojak, play

direct clitoral stimulation, some women say psychic
orgasm can be achieved. All one needs is either a risqué
novel or a full bladder. No doubt, euphemisms have been
coined just for such occurrences, but we are still digesting
the information.

Pokin’ the Pucker
The word dildo has been in use since the 16th century, but
there is evidence the item was created not long after Eve
herself. The ancient Greeks called them godemiches, the
French, bijoux indiscrets. Made of glass or velvet, they
were also known as paprilla, cazzi, consolateurs, and bienfaiteurs.
Whatever one’s position on the use of mechanical
devices to achieve sexual fulfillment, we can agree that
today’s battery-powered vibrators are
a vast improvement over 18th century
ladies’ penchant for turkey necks
(headless, carcass-less turkey necks
we pray, else it’s a whole other story).
Today, if a woman employs an indiscreet toy too . . . enthusiastically
upon herself, the medical community refers
to it as a picket fence injury. Masturbatory mishaps by the
male of the species seem to revolve around where, shall we
say, the evidence might happen to land and is rarely lethal
(notwithstanding Portnoy’s worry about the bathroom light
bulb). As far as we have evidence, that story about the
young man whose investigation of the erotic effects of a
vacuum cleaner hose left him with a severely elongated
penis, is only an urban legend.
Although many believe that inflatable dolls are a recent
phenomenon, we understand that there was such a thing for
horny sailors called a Dutch sea wife. How anatomically
correct these dolls were remains unascertained, but a

A spouse’s infidelity is grounds for divorce (if not an
exchange of gunfire). If one wanders a bit (“I was thinking
of you the whole time, honey”), it begs forgiveness.
In the 1900s, those guilty of facile morals committed a
marriage breach by engaging in illicit embraces. Now, if
intimacy, lovemaking, magne t ism, procreation, relations, reproduction,
125
one’s affections stray, it is called offshore drilling, parallel
parking, or extra curricular activity. In any case, one
is likely to be the recipient of a folded piece of paper announcing
one’s imminent matchruptcy, dewife-ing, or
splitting of the sheets spelled D-I-V-O-R-C-E and the
lawyers won’t be kind. To remain faithful to one’s vows,
however, is to keep league and truce.
If one is not in a committed relationship and simply
screwing around, it is an affaire d’ amour (which is French
for one night stand). Hence, one is in an irregular situation,
breaking the pale, and indecorously familiar.

a derivation). The basis for bald-headed hermit and oneeyed
trouser snake seem far less obscure.
The ancient term for the male appendage was yard. This,
mercifully, was when this word meant a stick or rod, not
thirty-six inches. Almost as ancient is man’s inclination to
give his appendage a pet name. This selection often reflects
the esteem (or lack thereof ) in which said member is held
by its owner—Big Steve, Pile-Driver, merry-maker,
General Custer, He Who Must Be Obeyed, Old Faithless,
or Sleeping Beauty. For pomposity, one cannot top
plenipo, an abbreviation of plenipotentiary, which means
“a diplomatic agent invested with full power to transact
business.” We also hear Tommy, Dick, Harry, Willie,
Giorgio, Percy, and Peter (which reminds us that it was
Groucho Marx who observed that actor Peter O’Toole’s
name was a penis euphemism times two).
The terms bayonet, bazooka, blade,
brachmard, dagger, dirk, gun, sword, and

Related Historical Events: Like the American Revolution,
the French Revolution was launched in the spirit of rational
thought and political liberty. But these ideals of the 18thcentury
Enlightenment period were soon compromised when
the French Revolution devolved into the “Terror”—a violent
period of beheadings by the very citizens who overthrew the
tyrannous French monarchy. The French Revolution cast a
long shadow into 19th-century Britain, as industrialization
seemed to divide the English population into the rich and
poor. Many people feared the oppressed working class
would start an English Revolution, but a series of political
compromises and wake-up calls like Dickens’s A Tale of Two
Cities helped to avert the potential crisis.

Author Bio
Full Name: Charles Dickens
Date of Birth: 1812
Place of Birth: Portsmouth, Hampshire, England
Date of Death: 1870
Brief Life Story: Born to a naval clerk, Dickens moved
with his family to London at age 10. When his father was
briefly imprisoned for debt, Charles worked long days at a
warehouse. He left school at age 15, but read voraciously
and acquired extensive knowledge through jobs as a law
clerk, court reporter, and journalist. As a novelist, Dickens
was successful from the start and quickly became the most
famous writer in Victorian England for his unforgettable
characters, comic ingenuity, and biting social critique. He also
enjoyed huge popularity in America where he made several
reading tours. He worked tirelessly, producing a magazine
Household Words (later All the Year Round) and cranking out
still-famous novels including Oliver Twist, Bleak House, Great
Expectations, and David Copperfield. Dickens had ten children
with his wife Catherine Hogarth, but their marriage was never
happy and Catherine left him after Dickens had an affair with
the actress Ellen Ternan. Dickens died in 1870 and is buried in
Poets’ Corner of Westminster Abbey.
The year is 1775. On a mission for his employer, Tellson’s Bank,
Mr. Jarvis Lorry travels to Dover to meet Lucie Manette. On
his way, Mr. Lorry receives a mysterious message and replies
with the words “Recalled to life.” When they meet, Mr. Lorry
reveals to Lucie that her father, Dr. Alexandre Manette, who
she thought was dead, is still alive. Dr. Manette had been secretly
imprisoned for 18 years in the Bastille, but his former servant
Monsieur Defarge, who now owns a wine shop in Paris that
is a center of revolutionary activities, has smuggled Dr. Manette
out of prison and hidden him in the store’s attic. Meanwhile, Defarge’s
wife, Madame Defarge, secretly encodes the names of
the Revolution’s enemies into her knitting. Mr. Lorry and Lucie
arrive in Paris to find Manette compulsively making shoes in a
dark corner—prison has left him insane. Lucie lovingly restores
him to himself and they return to London.
The year is 1780. In London, Charles Darnay stands trial for
treason as a spy. Lucie and Dr. Manette attend, having met Darnay
during their return from France. The defense lawyer is Mr.
Stryver, but it is his bored-looking associate, Sydney Carton,
who wins the case. Carton points out how much he himself resembles
Darnay in order to ruin the main witness’s credibility.
In France, the wealthy aristocracy wallows in luxury and
ignores the suffering poor. Marquis St. Evrémonde recklessly
runs over and kills a child with his carriage. At his castle,
he meets his nephew Charles Evrémonde (a.k.a. Darnay) who
has returned to France to renounce his family. That night, the
Marquis is murdered in his sleep.
Back in England, Charles, Stryver, and Sydney Carton all
frequently visit Dr. Manette and Lucie. Mr. Stryver plans to
propose to Lucie, but Mr. Lorry warns him that his proposal is
unlikely to be accepted. Carton also admires Lucie; he tells her
how she makes him believe that, despite his ruined past, he still
has a shred of goodness deep within him. Charles obtains Dr.
Manette’s permission to marry Lucie, but Manette refuses to
learn Charles’s real name until the wedding day. On the wedding
day, Dr. Manette relapses into his shoe-making madness after
discovering that Charles is an Evrémonde. Mr. Lorry helps him
recover. Charles and Lucie soon have a daughter of their own.
The year is 1789. Defarge leads the peasants in destroying
the Bastille. He searches Dr. Manette’s old cell and finds a letter
hidden in the chimney. The new Republic is declared, but its
citizens grow extremely violent, imprisoning and killing aristocrats.
Charles’s former servant, Gabelle, writes a letter from
prison asking for help. Charles secretly leaves for Paris and is
immediately taken prisoner. Mr. Lorry travels to Paris on bank
business and is soon joined by Lucie and Dr. Manette. Because
of his imprisonment, Dr. Manette is a local hero. He uses his
influence to get Charles a trial, but it takes over a year. Every day
Lucie walks near the prison hoping Charles will see her. Charles
is finally freed after Dr. Manette testifies. But that very night, he
is arrested again on charges brought by Monsieur and Madame
Defarge.
Miss Pross and Jerry Cruncher have come to Paris to
help. On the street, they run into Miss Pross’s brother, Solomon
Pross, whom Jerry recognizes from Charles’s English trial as
John Barsad. Sydney Carton also shows up and, threatening to
reveal Barsad as a spy, forces his cooperation to help Charles.
At Charles’s second trial, Defarge produces Dr. Manette’s
letter from the Bastille, which explains how the twin Evrémonde
brothers—Charles’s father and uncle—brutalized a peasant
girl and her brother, then imprisoned Manette to protect themselves.
Charles is sentenced to death and sent back to prison.
Realizing his letter has doomed Charles, Dr. Manette loses his
mind. That night, Carton overhears Madame Defarge at her wine
shop plotting against Lucie and her daughter in order to exterminate
the Evrémonde line. It is revealed that Madame Defarge
was the sister of the peasants the Evrémondes killed.
Carton conspires with Mr. Lorry to get everyone in a carriage
ready to flee for England. With Barsad’s help, Carton gets into
Charles’s prison cell, drugs him, and swaps clothes with him.
Barsad drags the disguised Charles back to Mr. Lorry’s carriage,
which bolts for England. Madame Defarge shows up at Lucie’s
apartment, but Miss Pross blocks her way. The two scuffle.
When Madame Defarge tries to draw her pistol, she accidentally
shoots herself. The blast deafens Miss Pross for life.
On his way to the guillotine in place of Charles, Carton
promises to hold hands with a young seamstress, who has
been wrongly accused. He dies knowing that his sacrifice was
the greatest thing he’s ever done.
Plot Summary
Characters
Charles Darnay (a.k.a. Charles Evrémonde) – Renouncing
the terrible sins of his family, the Evrémondes, Charles
abandons his position in the French aristocracy to make his own
way in England. Charles believes in the revolutionary ideal of
liberty, but is not a radical revolutionary. Instead, he represents
a rational middle ground between the self-satisfied exploitation
practiced by the old aristocracy and the murderous rage
exhibited by the revolutionaries. Charles has a heroic sense of
justice and obligation, as shown when he arranges to provide for
the oppressed French peasantry, and later endangers himself
in coming to Gabelle’s aid. However, Charles is also deluded
in thinking he can divert the force of history and change the
Revolution for the better. Similarly, Charles constantly overlooks
Sydney Carton’s potential and must learn from his wife, Lucie,
to have faith in Carton. Charles represents an imperfect but
virtuous humanity in whose future we must trust.
Dr. Alexandre Manette – An accomplished French physician
who gets imprisoned in the Bastille, and loses his mind. In his
madness, Manette embodies the terrible psychological trauma of
persecution from tyranny. Manette is eventually “resurrected”—
saved from his madness—by the love of his daughter, Lucie.
Manette also shows how suffering can become strength when
he returns to Paris and gains a position of authority within the
Revolution. Manette tries to return the favor of resurrection when
he saves Charles Evrémonde at his trial. However, Manette
is ultimately a tragic figure: his old letter from the Bastille seals
Charles’s fate. Falling once more into madness, Manette’s story
implies that individuals cannot escape the fateful pull of history.
Lucie Manette – The daughter of Dr. Manette, and
Charles’s wife. With her qualities of innocence, devotion, and
abiding love, Lucie has the power to resurrect, or recall her
father back to life, after his long imprisonment. Lucie is the
novel’s central figure of goodness and, against the forces of
history and politics, she weaves a “golden thread” that knits together
the core group of characters. Lucie represents religious
faith: when no one else believes in Sydney Carton, she does.
Her pity inspires his greatest deed.

A Tale of Two Cities
Sydney Carton – In his youth, Sydney Carton wasted his
great potential and mysteriously lost a woman he loved. Now
he’s a drunk and a lawyer who takes no credit for his work.
Carton has no hope for his life. Only Lucie understands his
potential for goodness. In his selfless dedication to her and her
family, Carton represents the transformative power of love. His
self-sacrifice at the end of the novel makes him a Christ figure.
By saving Lucie’s family, Carton redeems himself from sin and
lives on in their grateful memory.
Monsieur Defarge – The former servant of Dr. Manette,
Defarge uses his Paris wine shop as a place to organize French
revolutionaries. Like his wife, Madame Defarge, Defarge
is fiercely committed to overthrowing tyranny and avenging
injustice. Yet Defarge always retains a shred of mercy, and
does not participate in his wife’s plot to kill Lucie. This quality
of mercy makes Defarge a symbol for the failed Revolution,
which ultimately loses sight of its ideals and revels in the
violence it causes.
Madame Defarge – The wife of Monsieur Defarge, Madame
Defarge assists the revolutionaries by stitching the names of
their enemies into her knitting. Madame Defarge wants political
liberty for the French people, but she is even more powerfully
motivated by a bloodthirsty desire for revenge, hoping to
exterminate anyone related to the Evrémondes. Where Lucie
Manette is the embodiment of pity and goodness, Madame
Defarge is her opposite, a figure of unforgiving rage. Over the
course of the novel she emerges as a kind of anti-Christ, completely
devoid of mercy, and as such comes to symbolize the
French Revolution itself, which soon spun out of control and
descended into extreme violence.
Marquis St. Evrémonde – Charles’s uncle and a cruel
French aristocrat committed to preserving the power of the
French nobility. He and his twin brother exemplify the tyrannical
and uncaring aristocracy. When the Marquis is murdered,
his corpse is a symbol of the people’s murderous rage.
Mr. Jarvis Lorry – An older gentleman who works for
Tellson’s bank, Lorry is a model of loyalty and discretion. Lorry
hides his emotions under the cover of “business,” but he works
hard to save the Manettes and to encourage Charles to become
Lucie’s husband.
Mr. Stryver – A lawyer who defends Charles Darnay.
Stryver, as his name implies, only cares about climbing the
professional ladder.
Jerry Cruncher – By day, an odd-job man for Mr. Lorry.
By night, a “resurrection man”—robbing graves to sell body
parts to sketchy doctors. He complains about his wife’s praying
because it makes him feel guilty about his secret activities,
but by the end of the novel he decides to give up his secret job
and endorses praying, a sign that he hopes to be resurrected
himself through the power of Christ.
John Barsad (a.k.a Solomon Pross) – Barsad was born
Solomon Pross, brother to Miss Pross, but then became a
spy, first for the English, then later for the French government.
He is an amoral opportunist. In England, he accuses Charles
Darnay of treason.
Jacques Three – “Jacques” is the code name for every male
revolutionary; they identify themselves by number. Jacques
Three is a cruel, bloodthirsty man who represents the corruption
of the Revolution’s ideals. He controls the jury at the
prison tribunals.
The Vengeance – A peasant woman from Paris and Madame
Defarge’s ultraviolent sidekick. Like Madame Defarge
and Jacques Three, The Vengeance enjoys killing for its own
sake, not for any reasonable political purpose.
The mender of roads (the wood-sawyer) – A French
working man who represents how average people become seduced
by the worst, most violent qualities of the Revolution.
Gabelle – A servant of Charles Evrémonde who carries
out Charles’s secret charities. Gabelle is jailed simply by association
with the aristocracy, showing how justice flies out the
window during the Revolution.
Roger Cly – A spy and colleague of John Barsad who faked
his death to escape prosecution.
Miss Pross – The long-time, devoted servant of Lucie Manette.
She is Solomon Pross’s sister, and hates the French.
Monseigneur – A powerful French aristocrat.
Tyranny and Revolution
Much of the action of A Tale of Two Cities takes place in Paris
during the French Revolution, which began in 1789. In A Tale
of Two Cities, Dickens shows how the tyranny of the French
aristocracy—high taxes, unjust laws, and a complete disregard
for the well-being of the poor—fed a rage among the commoners
that eventually erupted in revolution. Dickens depicts this
process most clearly through his portrayal of the decadent
Marquis St. Evrémonde and the Marquis’ cruel treatment of
the commoners who live in the region under his control.
However, while the French commoners’ reasons for revolting
were entirely understandable, and the French Revolution was
widely praised for its stated ideals of “Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity,“
Dickens takes a more pessimistic view. By showing how
the revolutionaries use oppression and violence to further their
own selfish and bloodthirsty ends, in A Tale of Two Cities Dickens
suggests that whoever is in power, nobles or commoners, will
fall prey to the temptation to exercise their full power. In other
words, Dickens shows that while tyranny will inevitably lead to
revolution, revolution will lead just as inevitably to tyranny. The
only way to break this cycle is through the application of justice
and mercy.
Secrecy and Surveillance
Everybody in A Tale of Two Cities seems to have secrets:
Dr. Manette’s forgotten history detailed in his secret letter;
Charles’s secret past as an Evrémonde; Mr. Lorry’s tightlipped
attitude about the “business” of Tellson’s Bank; Jerry
Cruncher’s secret profession; and Monsieur and Madame
Defarge’s underground activities in organizing the Revolution.
In part, all this secrecy results from political instability. In the
clash between the French aristocracy and revolutionaries, both
sides employ spies to find out their enemies’ secrets and deal
out harsh punishments to anyone suspected of being an enemy.
In such an atmosphere, everyone suspects everyone else, and
everyone feels that they must keep secrets in order to survive.
Through the secrets kept by different characters, A Tale of
Two Cities also explores a more general question about the
human condition: what can we really know about other people,
including those we’re closest to? Even Lucie cannot fathom
the depths of Dr. Manette’s tortured mind, while Sydney
Carton remains a mystery to everybody. Ultimately, through
Lucie’s example, the novel shows that, in fact, you can’t ever
know everything about other people. Instead, it suggests that
love and faith are the only things that can bridge the gap between
two individuals.
Fate and History
Madame Defarge with her knitting and Lucie Manette
weaving her “golden thread” both resemble the Fates, goddesses
from Greek mythology who literally controlled the
“threads” of human lives. As the presence of these two Fate
figures suggests, A Tale of Two Cities is deeply concerned with
human destiny. In particular, the novel explores how the fates
of individuals are shaped by their personal histories and the
broader forces of political history. For instance, both Charles
and Dr. Manette try to shape and change history. Charles
seeks to escape from his family’s cruel aristocratic history
and make his own way in London, but is inevitably drawn “like
a magnet” back to France where he must face his family’s
past. Later in the novel, Dr. Manette seeks to use his influence
within the Revolution to try to save Charles’s life from the
revolutionaries, but Dr. Manette’s own forgotten past resurfaces
in the form of an old letter that dooms Charles. Through
these failures of characters to change the flow of history or to
escape their own pasts, A Tale of Two Cities suggests that the
force of history can be broken not by earthly appeals to justice
or political influence, but only through Christian self-sacrifice,
such as Carton’s self-sacrifice that saves Charles at the end
of the novel.
Sacrifice
A Tale of Two Cities is full of examples of sacrifice, on both a
personal and national level. Dr. Manette sacrifices his freedom
in order to preserve his integrity. Charles sacrifices his family
wealth and heritage in order to live a life free of guilt for his family’s
awful behavior. The French people are willing to sacrifice
their own lives to free themselves from tyranny. In each case,
Dickens suggests that, while painful in the short term, sacrifice
leads to future strength and happiness. Dr. Manette is reunited
with his daughter and gains a position of power in the French
Revolution because of his earlier incarceration in the Bastille.
Charles wins the love of Lucie. And France, Dickens suggests
at the end of the novel, will emerge from its terrible and bloody
revolution to a future of peace and prosperity.
Yet none of these sacrifices can match the most important
sacrifice in the novel—Sydney Carton’s decision to sacrifice his
life in order to save the lives of Lucie, Charles, and their family.
The other characters’ actions fit into the secular definition of
“sacrifice,” in which a person gives something up for noble reasons.
Carton’s sacrifice fits the Christian definition of the word.
In Christianity, God sacrifices his son Jesus in order to redeem
mankind from sin. Carton’s sacrifice breaks the grip of fate and
history that holds Charles, Lucie, Dr. Manette, and even, as the
novel suggests, the revolutionaries.
Resurrection
Closely connected to the theme of sacrifice is the promise of
resurrection. Christianity teaches that Christ was resurrected
into eternal life for making the ultimate sacrifice (his death)
for mankind. Near the end of A Tale of Two Cities, Carton
remembers a Christian prayer: “I am the resurrection and the
life.” As he goes to the guillotine to sacrifice himself, Carton
has a vision of his own resurrection, both in heaven and on
earth through Lucie and Charles’s child, named Sydney Carton,
whose life fulfills the original Carton’s lost potential. Yet
Carton’s is not the only resurrection in the novel. After having
been imprisoned for years, Dr. Manette is “recalled to life” by
Lucie’s love. Jerry Cruncher, meanwhile, works as a “resurrection
man” stealing body parts from buried corpses, but by
the end of the novel he gives it up in favor of praying for a holier
resurrection of his own.
Imprisonment
In the novel, the Bastille symbolizes the nobility’s abuse of
power, exemplified by the unjust imprisonment of Dr. Manette
by Marquis St. Evrémonde. Yet the Bastille is not the
only prison in A Tale of Two Cities. The revolutionaries also
unjustly imprison Charles in La Force prison. Through this parallel,
Dickens suggests that the French revolutionaries come to
abuse their power just as much as the nobility did.
The theme of imprisonment also links to the theme of history
and fate. For instance, when Charles is drawn back to
Paris because of his own past actions, each checkpoint he
passes seems to him like a prison door shutting behind him.

Summary and Analysis
Book 1, Chapter 1: The Period
“It was the best of times, it was the worst of
times…” The year is 1775, a time that the narrator
describes through a set of contradictions: wisdom
and foolishness, belief and disbelief, optimism and
doubt, light and darkness, hope and despair. The
narrator compares this historical era to his own
present moment in Victorian England.
The contradictions listed in the
opening of the novel portray
1775 as an age of profound
transition, full of promise and
threat. The comparison to Dickens’s
Victorian times establishes
the novel’s use of the past to
comment on the present.
In France, the government spends wildly and hands
out harsh sentences to anyone connected with a
crime, no matter how minor. In England, burglars
infest the cities—even the Mayor of London gets
robbed—and not even frequent hangings can stop
the wave of crime.
The narrator extends the
potential similarities between
revolutionary France and England.
Because of their injustices,
both governments are sowing
the seeds of discontent and
political radicalism.
The narrator tells an allegory of the Woodman and
the Farmer—figures of the coming revolution who are
silently at work. But the royalty in both England and
France believe in their divine right to rule and don’t
notice the gathering storm.
The Woodman stands for Death
and the Farmer for Fate. Both,
the narrator implies, will harvest
the awful products of the monarchy’s
political mistakes.
Book 1, Chapter 2: The Mail
On a stormy night in late November 1775, the mail
coach from London slogs its way toward Dover. Three
passengers sit in the carriage. Everyone is suspicious
of each other. When he hears an approaching horse,
the coach driver stops the carriage: it’s a messenger
seeking one of the passengers, Mr. Jarvis Lorry of
Tellson’s Bank. Mr. Lorry recognizes the man as Jerry
Cruncher, who works odd-jobs for Tellson’s.
The port city of Dover was the
main port for passage between
England and France. The road
from London to Dover, battered
by storm and fraught with
suspicion and highwaymen, represents
the worsening political
conditions in both countries.
Jerry gives Mr. Lorry a note that reads “Wait at
Dover for Mam’selle.” In reply, Mr. Lorry tells Jerry
to return to Tellson’s with the message: “Recalled
to life.” The coach drivers overhear the mysterious
message but can make nothing of it. Neither can
Jerry, though he worries that “recalling to life” would
be bad for his other work.
“Recalled to life” sets up the
theme of resurrection. At both
ends of the book, someone
liberates another person from
prison and saves them from
the grave. Jerry’s odd thought
establishes the mystery of what
his other work might be.
Book 1, Chapter 3: The Night Shadows
The narrator reflects on the strangeness of the human
condition: how we are all mysteries to each other. No
matter how close, we always remain alienated from
each other by our unique individualities.
One of the main themes in all
of Dickens’s work is the search
for mutual understanding and
human sympathy.
Half asleep in the mail coach, Mr. Lorry dreams of
wandering through the inner vaults of Tellson’s Bank
and finding everything safe. He also dreams that he
“was on his way to dig someone out of a grave.” In
his dream, he sees a cadaverous man who has been
buried alive for 18 years. Mr. Lorry asks the man if he
cares to live, then also asks over and over if the man
will “come and see her?” Sometimes the man cries
out that seeing “her” would kill him, at other times
that he must see her immediately.
Mr. Lorry’s dream foreshadows
Dr. Manette’s situation. Lorry’s
questions about whether the
man “cares to live” and whether
he wants to see “her,” link the
idea of Manette’s potential return
to life with a woman, suggesting
that it is love that will
return him to life. The dream
of digging up someone from a
grave also foreshadows Jerry’s
other job as a grave robber.
Book 1, Chapter 4: The Preparation
In Dover, Mr. Lorry takes a room at the Royal George
Hotel. The 17-year-old Lucie Manette arrives that
same afternoon, having received vague instructions
to meet a Tellson’s Bank employee at the Royal
George Hotel regarding some business of her “long
dead” father. Though he describes his news as just
a “business matter,” Mr. Lorry struggles with his
emotions as he explains the “story of one of our
customers”—Lucie’s father, Dr. Manette.
Mr. Lorry works like a secret
agent for Tellson’s Bank. He
uses the cover of “business” to
assist in political activities (like
freeing Dr. Manette). But he
also uses “business” rhetoric
to hide his feelings and protect
others’ emotions, even when
explaining a father’s history to
his daughter.
20 years ago, Dr. Manette, a renowned doctor,
married an English woman and trusted his affairs
to Tellson’s Bank. One day, Manette disappeared,
having been jailed by the authorities and taken to a
secret prison. Rather than tell Lucie the truth, Lucie’s
mother told her that her father was dead. Lucie’s
mother herself died soon afterwards, and Mr. Lorry
took Lucie from Paris to London.
Lucie learns her own and her
father’s real history—her father
suffered imprisonment at the
hand of a tyrannical government.
Lucie’s history makes her a
figure who connects the “two cities”
of Paris and London, and in
A Tale of Two Cities, characters
cannot escape their histories.
Mr. Lorry braces Lucie for a shock: her father is not
dead. He has been found, though he’s a shell of his
former self. Manette is now in the care of a former
servant in Paris, and Mr. Lorry tells the astonished
Lucie that he and she are going to go to Paris so that
she can “restore [her father] to life.” Lucie’s servant,
the loud and red-haired Miss Pross, rushes in and
shouts at Mr. Lorry for upsetting Lucie. Mr. Lorry
asks her to travel with them to France.
Though freed from jail, Manette
is still imprisoned by his traumatic
history. It now becomes
clear that Lucie is the woman
whom Lorry in his dream hoped
could save Manette. Miss Pross
is a stereotypical British servant,
brash, devoted to her mistress.
Book 1, Chapter 5: The Wine-shop
Outside a wine shop in the poor Parisian suburb of
Saint Antoine, a cask of wine accidentally falls and
breaks in the street. Everyone in the area scrambles
to drink the runoff: cupping their hands, slurping it out
of gutters, licking it off the fragments of the broken
cask. It turns into a game with dancing and singing in
the streets. The wine has stained the ground, stained
people’s skin and clothes. Someone jokingly uses the
spilled wine to scrawl the word “Blood” on a wall.
This scene is an extended
metaphor for how people
transform into a frenzied mob.
It foreshadows the blood to be
spilled in the Revolution. The
writing on the wall alludes to
the Biblical story (in Daniel)
of Belshazzar’s feast where a
disembodied hand prophesied
the fall of his empire.
The color-coded bars in Summary and Analysis make it easy to track the themes through the
work. Each color corresponds to one of the themes explained in the Themes section. For instance,
a bar of indicates that all six themes apply to that part of the summary.
Wine
Defarge’s wine shop lies at the center of revolutionary Paris,
and throughout the novel wine symbolizes the Revolution’s intoxicating
power. Drunk on power, the revolutionaries change
from freedom fighters into wild savages dancing in the streets
and murdering at will. The deep red color of wine suggests that
wine also symbolizes blood. When the Revolution gets out of
control, blood is everywhere; everyone seems soaked in its
color. This symbolizes the moral stains on the hands of revolutionaries.
The transformation of wine to blood traditionally
alludes to the Christian Eucharist (in which wine symbolizes
the blood of Christ), but Dickens twists this symbolism: he uses
wine-to-blood to symbolize brutality rather than purification,
implying that the French Revolution has become unholy.
Knitting and the Golden Thread
In classical mythology, three sister gods called the Fates controlled
the threads of human lives. A Tale of Two Cities adapts
the classical Fates in two ways. As she knits the names of her
enemies, Madame Defarge is effectively condemning people
to a deadly fate. On the other hand, as Lucie weaves her
“golden thread” through people’s lives, she binds them into
a better destiny: a tightly-knit community of family and close
friends. In each case, Dickens suggests that human destinies
are either predetermined by the force of history or they are tied
into a larger pattern than we as individuals realize.
Guillotine
The guillotine, a machine designed to behead its victims, is
one of the enduring symbols of the French Revolution. In Tale
of Two Cities, the guillotine symbolizes how revolutionary chaos
gets institutionalized. With the guillotine, killing becomes
emotionless and automatic, and human life becomes cheap.
The guillotine as a symbol expresses exactly what Dickens
meant by adding the two final words (“or Death”) to the end
of the French national motto: “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or
Death.”
Shoes and Footsteps
At her London home, Lucie hears the echoes of all the footsteps
coming into their lives. These footsteps symbolize fate.
Dr. Manette makes shoes in his madness. Notably, he always
makes shoes in response to traumatic memories of tyranny, as
when he learns Charles’s real name is Evrémonde. For this
reason, shoes come to symbolize the inescapable past.

The jubilation fades and the street returns to its sad,
dirty, impoverished condition. The people are sick
and aged, beaten down by hunger.
Hunger and want are the
conditions that fuel the revolutionary
fire.
Monsieur Defarge, the owner of the wine shop,
enters his store. From her position behind the
counter, his wife, Madame Defarge, silently alerts
him to the presence of Mr. Lorry and Lucie. Defarge
ignores them, instead lamenting the condition of the
people with three men, all of whom go by the name
“Jacques” (a code name used by revolutionaries in
France).
The code name “Jacques” does
double service: because it is a
common name, it both hides
identity and also implies that
this revolution is of the people.
Lucie and Lorry’s presence in
Defarge’s wine shop indicates
that Defarge is Manette’s
former servant.
Once the “Jacques” have left, Mr. Lorry speaks with
Monsieur Defarge. Defarge leads Mr. Lorry and
Lucie up to his attic. The room is dark and kept locked
for the sake of the inhabitant, Monsieur Defarge
explains. Lucie leans on Mr. Lorry for support. Defarge
opens the door and they see a white-haired man in
the corner stooped over a bench and making shoes.
Because his mind was unoccupied
in prison, Dr. Manette
compensated by making shoes
to occupy his hands. Now, even
though he is free, he can’t
escape the prison of his own
mind, so he continues to make
shoes.
Book 1, Chapter 6: The Shoemaker
The shoemaker is dressed in tatters. When Defarge
asks him his name, he replies “One Hundred and Five,
North Tower.” Mr. Lorry then asks the shoemaker if
he recognizes anyone. The shoemaker seems as if he
does for a moment, but his face quickly clouds over.
Dr. Manette suffered so greatly
in prison that his identity was
virtually erased. He knows himself
only by the room number in
the Bastille, the prison in which
he was held.
Lucie approaches, with tears in her eyes. The
shoemaker asks who she is. Noticing her blonde hair,
he removes a necklace he wears and reveals a scrap
of paper containing some golden threads of hair—
stray hairs from his wife, which he has kept all these
years as a spiritual escape from his imprisonment.
Overcome by emotion, Manette struggles to
recognize his daughter. Lucie rocks Manette’s head
on her chest like a child. She promises him that his
agony has ended, and gives thanks to God.
Lucie’s golden hair reminds Manette
of his wife’s golden hair.
These hairs, from before and
after Manette’s incarceration,
form a kind of bridge over his
years in prison. These are the
“golden threads” with which Lucie
weaves a better fate for her
family. Cradling Manette, Lucie
is like a mother and Manette
her child—a metaphor for
Manette’s new life ahead.
Mr. Lorry and Defarge arrange for their immediate
departure. Before he leaves, Manette asks to bring
along his shoemaking tools. With Defarge escorting
them, the group is able to get past the barricades
in the street and reach a carriage. Mr. Lorry asks Dr.
Manette if he wants to be recalled to life. Dr. Manette
replies, “I can’t say.”
Dr. Manette’s desire to keep his
tools close at hand indicates
that his emotional trauma still
lies close to the surface. Dr.
Manette’s statement, “I can’t
say,” indicates that he doesn’t
yet totally believe in the possibility
that he could escape his
traumatic past.
Book 2, Chapter 1: Five Years Later
The year is 1780. The narrator describes Tellson’s
Bank in London as an old, cramped building with
ancient clerks. The bank has business interests
connecting England and France. Encrusted by
tradition and unwilling to change, the bank seems
much like England itself.
The bank is a symbol of
England and France. Like the
tradition-encrusted bank, each
of these countries has problems
with the institutions they’ve
inherited, such as the monarchy.
In his cramped apartment in a poor London
neighborhood, Jerry Cruncher yells at his wife for
“praying against” him, which he insists is interfering
with his work as an “honest tradesman.”
Jerry’s dislike of praying and
insistence that it interferes with
his business, implies that his
work as an “honest tradesmen”
makes him feel guilty.
Jerry and his son then go to work—they sit outside
Tellson’s waiting for odd jobs from the bank. On this
day, word emerges from the bank that a porter is
needed. Jerry hurries inside. Jerry’s young son, left
alone outside, wonders why his father’s boots are
muddy and his fingers stained by rust.
The stains of guilt on Jerry’s
conscience are represented
by the mud and rust from his
nocturnal work, which is as of
yet still unrevealed.
Book 2, Chapter 2: A Sight
One day, Jerry Cruncher is sent to await Mr.
Lorry’s orders at the Old Bailey Courthouse, where a
handsome young gentleman named Charles Darnay
stands accused of treason. Jerry enters the court and
pushes through the crowd gathered to see the trial.
The spectators stare at Darnay, and one onlooker
excitedly predicts that the accused will be convicted
and then brutally drawn-and-quartered.
The sadistic appetites of this
English crowd are similar to
those of the French mob in
Book 1, chapter 5. The title of
the chapter, “A Sight,” indicates
that these people come to the
trial for the fun of it, hoping not
for justice but for the spectacle
of violence.
Charles, who stands accused of being a French
spy, is defended by two lawyers: Mr. Stryver and
the insolent and bored-looking Mr. Carton. When
Darnay glances at a young woman and her father
sitting nearby (Lucie and Dr. Manette), word flashes
through the crowd that these two are witnesses
against Darnay. Nonetheless, Lucie’s face radiates a
compassion that awes the spectators.
The compassion in Lucie’s face
indicates that she does not
want to condemn Charles, even
though she is a witness for the
prosecution. This foreshadows
Charles’s final trial in Paris,
when Dr. Manette, contrary to
his intentions, dooms Charles.
Book 2, Chapter 3: A Disappointment
The Attorney General prosecuting the case demands
that the jury sentence Charles to death. He calls
a witness, the “unimpeachable patriot” John
Barsad, whose testimony implicates Charles as a
spy. However, on cross-examination Stryver reveals
Barsad to be a gambler and brawler and a generally
untrustworthy witness. Stryver similarly is able to
raise questions about the motivations of another
witness, Roger Cly, Charles’s former servant.
The prosecuting attorney
foreshadows the later prosecutors
in France who will bend
the truth to seek an execution.
Ironically, Charles is accused
of spying while John Barsad
and Roger Cly (who are later
revealed to be actual English
spies) are presented as “unimpeachable”
witnesses.
Mr. Lorry, Lucie, and Dr. Manette are each called to
testify: they had all met Charles aboard ship on their
way back from Paris five years earlier. Lucie explains
how Charles helped her care for her father, swaying
the jury in Charles’s favor. But she then accidentally
turns the court against Darnay. How? First she admits
that Charles was traveling with other Frenchmen and
carrying lists. Second she mentions Charles’s joking
comment that George Washington’s place in history
might one day match that of England’s King George III.
Another irony: as will be
revealed later, Charles’s “suspicious”
activities are actually his
humanitarian efforts to help his
impoverished tenants in France.
He is putting himself in danger
to help others. His comment
about George Washington
(who was leading the American
Revolution at the time) indicates
that he has revolutionary
sympathies.
Later, while Mr. Stryver is unsuccessfully crossexamining
a witness who has been called to identify
Charles, Carton hands Stryver a note. After reading
from the note, Stryver forces the court to notice the
striking resemblance between Charles and Carton,
shattering the witness’s credibility.
Besides serving an important
role in the plot, the uncanny
resemblance between Carton
and Charles links them and
sets them up as doubles to be
compared and contrasted.
The jury goes to deliberate. Carton continues to look
bored, stirring only to order help when he notices
Lucie start to faint. Finally, the jury returns from its
deliberations with a verdict of not guilty.
Carton’s boredom identifies him
as uninterested in the world
and empty. Only Lucie seems to
interest him.
Book 2, Chapter 4: Congratulatory
After the trial, Charles kisses Lucie’s hands in gratitude
and thanks Stryver for his help. Dr. Manette is now
a distinguished citizen of London. He can still become
gloomy, but this occurs only occasionally because
Lucie serves as a “golden thread” linking him to his
life before and after his imprisonment. Stryver, Dr.
Manette, and Lucie depart in a carriage.
Though Lucie’s love and compassion,
her “golden thread,”
have returned Dr. Manette’s
to life, his grip on sanity is still
tenuous, only as strong as a
thread of hair.
A drunk Sydney Carton emerges from the shadows.
His shabby clothes and impertinent manners offend
Mr. Lorry, who departs. Carton and Charles go out
to dinner at a tavern, where Carton slyly asks Charles
whether being tried for his life is worth the sympathy
and compassion he now gets from Lucie. Annoyed,
Charles comments on Carton’s drinking. In response,
Carton says, “I am a disappointed drudge, sir. I care for
no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for me.”
After Charles leaves, Carton curses his own reflection
in a mirror and then curses Charles, who reminds him
of what he might have been.
Carton’s lack of manners and
shabby looks show that he
doesn’t care much about life.
His bitter comments about the
compassion Charles receives
from Lucie show that Carton
craves Lucie’s pity. His words
also suggest that Carton only
saved Charles because he
wanted to help Lucie. Carton
curses Charles because their
resemblance forces Carton to
consider his own life, which was
ruined by some past experience.

Book 2, Chapter 5: The Jackal
The narrator describes Mr. Stryver as an ambitious
man starting to climb the professional ladder. Due to
his problem distilling information, he partnered with
Sydney Carton, who now secretly does all the work
for Stryver to win his cases. If Stryver is a lion in court,
Carton is a cunning jackal behind the scenes.
As his name implies, Stryver
“strives” to get ahead in the
world. He is uninterested in
sacrifice because he is only out
for himself.
After leaving the tavern where he dined with Charles,
Carton joins Stryver in his apartment. To stay awake,
he wraps a wet towel around his head and works
through a pile of legal documents. Stryver watches.
Carton willingly makes himself
a slave to Stryver’s legal work.
He is sacrificing his potential
for no reason, which is a kind
of suicide.
Afterwards, Stryver and Carton drink and talk.
Stryver comments on Carton’s moodiness and lack
of direction, which have been evident since their days
at university. Carton responds that he lacks Stryver’s
ambition, and must live in “rust and repose.” Stryver
changes the subject to Lucie’s beauty. Carton mocks
her as a “golden-haired doll,” but Stryver senses
Carton’s true feelings might be different.
This exchange reveals an
important part of Carton’s
character and history. He is
always working for others, never
seeking the credit, as Stryver
would. Carton’s denials about
his interest in Lucie don’t even
convince Stryver.
After leaving Stryver, Carton stumbles home
through the grey dawn, imagining for a moment a city
of hope, full of love and grace. But it passes and he
cries into his pillow, resigned to his miserable life.
Carton’s vision is of a celestial
city in heaven. But in his current
state of empty self-pity, he can
only glimpse it for a moment.
Book 2, Chapter 6: Hundreds of People
Four months pass. Mr. Lorry visits Dr. Manette and
Lucie at their home. Lucie has decorated the house
beautifully, but Mr. Lorry notices that Manette’s
shoe-making workbench is still in the house.
The beautiful house symbolizes
the Manettes’ return to life, but
the presence of the workbench
indicates that Manette is not
yet completely free of his past.
Dr. Manette and Lucie are out, though. Mr. Lorry
speaks with Miss Pross, who comments on and
dismisses all the suitors who constantly call on Lucie.
She adds that her brother, Solomon Pross, is the
only man good enough for Lucie. Lorry remains silent,
though he knows Solomon is a cheat and scoundrel.
Mr. Lorry then asks if Dr. Manette ever uses his
workbench or speaks about his imprisonment. Miss
Pross responds that Dr. Manette does not think about
his traumatic years of imprisonment.
Miss Pross’s comments
introduce her brother, while
Lorry’s skepticism establishes
that Solomon is not all that he
seems—he’s really a spy. Dr.
Manette’s silence about his
imprisonment and insistence
on keeping his shoe-making
workbench show that he has
not resolved his traumatic past:
he’s still hiding from it.
Lucie and Manette return. Charles arrives to visit
moments later. Charles tells them of his recent trip
to the Tower of London, where a workman recently
realized that what he had thought were someone’s
initials carved into a wall (“D.I.G.”) were actually
instructions: beneath the floor, they found the ashes
of a letter. Dr. Manette nearly faints at this story.
Charles’s story foreshadows
what will be discovered in Dr.
Manette’s old cell: his carved
initials and a letter telling his
story. Dr. Manette almost faints
because he can’t face his past
and senses the letter’s danger,
whether consciously or not.
Sydney Carton also visits. Sitting out on the veranda
as a storm approaches, Lucie tells him that she
sometimes imagines that the echoes of the footsteps
from the pedestrians below belong to people who will
soon come into their lives. Carton says it must be a
great crowd to make such a sound, and says that he
will welcome these people into his life.
The storm and footsteps
symbolize the oncoming French
Revolution. Carton’s comment
is prophetic: in the end, he
welcomes the Revolution into
his life and sacrifices himself to
the Revolution to save Lucie.
Book 2, Chapter 7: Monseigneur in Town
The scene cuts to Paris and the inner sanctum of
Monseigneur, a powerful French lord. He drinks
some hot chocolate with four richly dressed servants
to help him. Monseigneur is surrounded by luxury, by
state officials who know nothing of state business but
everything about dressing well. Every aristocrat there
seems disfigured by the “leprosy of unreality.”
The hot chocolate exemplifies
the nobility’s self-indulgent and
foolish focus on personal comforts.
They are so out of touch
with the hard realities of the
common people in France that
the narrator compares their
disconnection to a disease.
One sinister lord with a pinched nose, the Marquis
Evrémonde, leaves in a huff that the Monseigneur
did not treat him a bit more warmly. He takes out
his anger by having his carriage speed through the
streets, scattering the commoners in the way.
The Marquis cares only about
power. Feeling snubbed by the
Monseigneur, he makes himself
feel powerful again by taking it
out on the commoners, whom
he clearly cares nothing about.
The carriage runs over and kills a little girl. As a tall man
wails over his dead daughter, the Marquis scolds the
people for not taking care of their children and tosses
the man a gold coin. As his carriage pulls away, the
coin sails back in: Monsieur Defarge threw it back.
Furious, the Marquis screams that he will “exterminate
[the commoners] from the earth.” He drives away
while Madame Defarge looks on, knitting.
The girl’s death is a metaphor
for the brutality of tyranny.
Defarge throwing the coin back
shows how tyranny inspires
revolution, creating a situation
where both sides want to
destroy the other. For his actions
against the commoners, the
Marquis gets his name knitted
into Defarge’s register of death.
Book 2, Chapter 8: Monseigneur in the Country
Returning through the village he rules and has taxed
nearly to death, Marquis Evrémonde stops to
question a mender of roads who the Marquis had
noticed staring at his passing carriage. The man
explains that he saw someone hanging on beneath
the carriage who then ran off into the fields.
The stowaway represents how
the Marquis is bringing his own
troubles home to roost. The
trouble is spreading from the
cities through the country.
The Marquis drives on, passing a shoddy graveyard.
A woman approaches the carriage and petitions the
Marquis for help for her husband who has recently
died of hunger, like so many others. The Marquis
dismissively asks the women if she expects him to
be able to restore the dead man to life or to feed
everyone? The woman responds that all she wants is
a simple grave marker for her husband, so he won’t
be forgotten. The Marquis drives away.
The Marquis fails to realize
that he does have the power
to feed the people. But it would
require sympathizing with them
or even sacrificing some of
his prosperity and power. The
Marquis’s lack of pity contrasts
with Lucie’s compassion. Unlike
the Marquis, she has the power
to restore someone to life.
Book 2, Chapter 9: The Gorgon’s Head
At his luxurious castle, the Marquis Evrémonde waits
for the arrival of his nephew, Charles Evrémonde
(a.k.a. Charles Darnay) from London. Charles explains
he has been questing for a “sacred object,” but that
he’s run into trouble. The Marquis dismisses him, but
complains that the power of the French aristocracy
has waned. They used to hold the right of life and
death, and ruled by fear and repression.
The object of Charles’s sacred
quest is Lucie. Charles’ “trouble”
in winning her love is his
aristocratic background. Notice
also the contrast between Lucie
and the aristocracy: she has the
power to restore life, while the
French nobility rule through the
power of taking life away.
Charles responds that the Evrémondes have lost
their family honor by injuring anyone who stood
between them and pleasure. He adds that when his
mother died, she commanded him to have mercy
on the people. He renounces his family name and
property, which he says is cursed, and explains that
he will work for a living in England. The Marquis
scoffs at his nephew’s “new philosophy,” tells him to
accept his “natural destiny,” and goes to bed.
The “new philosophy” of the
Enlightenment, which inspired
both the American and French
Revolutions, held that all people
are born equal, that no one
has a natural right to rule. Yet
rather than facing his past,
Charles tries to run from it by
renouncing his family and living
and working in England.
As the morning dawns, the expressions on the
castle’s stone faces seem to have changed to shock.
Bells ring and villagers gather to share urgent news:
the Marquis has been found dead with a knife in his
chest and a note signed “Jacques.”
The stone faces represent the
old institution of the nobility,
shocked at the unthinkable: a
challenge to their power. Yet the
murder also shows that despite
their ideals, the revolutionaries
are as bloodthirsty and revengedriven
as the nobles.
Book 2, Chapter 10: Two Promises
A year passes. Charles now makes a passable living
in London as a French teacher. Charles visits Dr.
Manette. During the visit, Charles tells Dr. Manette
of his deep love for Lucie. Dr. Manette at first seems
frightened by the news, but relaxes when Charles
promises that he intends not to separate them, but to
share the Manettes’ home and bind Lucie closer to her
father. Dr. Manette suspects that Stryver and Carton
are also interested in Lucie, but promises to vouch for
Charles’s love for Lucie should Lucie ever ask.
Charles has sacrificed his
wealth and aristocratic heritage
to try to win Lucie’s love. Since
only Lucie’s love keeps Dr. Manette
sane, any threat to their
bond makes him worry. Charles
understands this and promises
that his relationship to Lucie
won’t interfere with Lucie’s
relationship with Manette.
Charles thanks Dr. Manette for his confidence in
him, and wants to return the favor by sharing a secret
of his own: his real name. But Manette suddenly
stops him. He asks Charles to tell him on the morning
of his wedding, not before. That night, Lucie returns
and finds her father again making shoes.
Dr. Manette must have a hunch
that Charles is an Evrémonde.
By stopping Charles from
revealing the truth, he continues
to try to repress his pain. But he
is not entirely successful, as his
return to shoemaking shows.

Book 2, Chapter 11: A Companion Picture
That same night, as Sydney Carton plows through
heaps of legal papers, Mr. Stryver announces
that he intends to get married. He chastises Carton
for acting strangely around people, especially the
Manettes. Stryver explains how he works to get along
with people, which gets him ahead in the world.
Stryver is not an evil character,
but he is selfish. All his actions
are focused on getting ahead.
He would never consider sacrificing
any of his hard-earned
success for any reason.
Because Carton had previously (though insincerely)
insulted Lucie, Stryver breaks the news to him
carefully: he plans to marry her. Stryver thinks she’s
a “charming creature” and will improve his home and
professional standing; besides, she would be lucky to
marry a man of such rising distinction. Carton drinks
harder and says almost nothing. Stryver worries
about Carton and tells him to get married, to settle
down with some wealthy woman.
Stryver wants Lucie for all
the wrong reasons: she’ll be a
trophy wife who will help him
professionally. This contrasts
with the feelings of profound
love that both Charles and
Carton feel for Lucie. Stryver
thinks that Carton can find
redemption on an earthly path,
like getting married for money.
Book 2, Chapter 12: The Fellow of Delicacy
On his way to Lucie Manette’s house to propose,
Mr. Stryver passes Tellson’s Bank and decides
to drop in on Mr. Lorry. When Stryver tells him of
his plans, Mr. Lorry stiffens and advises him not to
proceed. Stryver is stunned and insulted. Mr. Lorry
clarifies that he knows Lucie’s likely answer. But
Stryver cannot believe that any girl could refuse him.
Stryver thinks the world
revolves around him, that
everyone must believe in the
virtue of pursuing earthly
rewards, at which he excels. But
Mr. Lorry has a sense that Lucie
has different goals and a more
profound destiny.
Mr. Lorry asks Stryver to wait while he visits the
Manettes to see about Stryver’s chances. Stryver
agrees and returns home to think it over. When Mr.
Lorry arrives with the expected bad news, Stryver
has already decided to drop it. He explains that Lucie
shares the “vanities and giddiness of empty-headed
girls” and that he’s better off without her.
Stryver convinces himself he
never wanted Lucie. But his
insult about Lucie is so far off
that it shows his foolishness. A
selfish materialist like Stryver
will never deserve or receive the
rewards of love and restored life
that Lucie can provide.
Book 2, Chapter 13: The Fellow of No Delicacy
Although his awkward social skills obscure it, Sydney
Carton loves to visit the Manette house. After
Mr. Stryver informs him that he’s given up his
plans to propose, Carton visits Lucie for a private
conversation.
Carton’s earlier insults of Lucie
were just a show. From his visits,
it is clear that he loves and
admires her for her compassion
and goodness.
Lucie is astonished when Carton breaks into tears
over his wasted life during the visit. She asks if she
can help him, if she can persuade him to live a better
life. Carton says no, that his life was over long ago. But
Lucie responds that she believes he has it in him to live
a much worthier life, and that she can help him.
Carton’s past is a mystery. Not
unlike Dr. Manette, Carton has
been imprisoned in his own
depression since some trauma
in his youth. Even he does not
anticipate the great deeds he is
capable of, but Lucie does.
Carton tells Lucie he loves her, that she is “the last
dream of [his] soul.” But that even if she loved him
back, he would probably just make her miserable.
Carton asks only one thing: for Lucie to confirm that
there is still something in him to pity, some shred of
humanity to sympathize with. She does and Carton
tells Lucie he would do anything, even give his own
life, for her and the family she loves.
Prophetic words. Carton’s soul
dreams of Lucie’s pity, of being
forgiven and welcomed by her
boundless compassion. Carton
sees this compassion as the
most important thing in the
world, and with the strength he
derives from Lucie’s faith, he
would do anything to protect it.
Book 2, Chapter 14: The Honest Tradesman
Outside of Tellson’s Bank, Jerry Cruncher sees an
approaching funeral procession. An angry crowd
harasses the drivers of the hearse with shouts of
“Spies!” Cruncher learns the hearse carries the body
of Roger Cly, a convicted spy against the English.
The English crowd threatening
the spies foreshadows the
French mob that, in later
chapters, will actually lynch its
enemies in public.
Jerry follows the mob, which roughs up the drivers
and takes over the procession. They drive into the
country and bury Roger Cly with mock ceremony.
Then they start carousing, busting up local pubs until
the police intervene.
The mobs’ anger at the spy
Roger Cly escalates into a
general zest for mayhem,
foreshadowing the French
revolutionaries who lose sight
of their ideals in their thirst
for blood.
Back at home, Jerry once again complain’s about his
wife’s praying. His son, Young Jerry, asks his father
about where he goes at night. Jerry tells his son that
he goes fishing, as Mrs. Cruncher knows.
Mrs. Cruncher knows Jerry’s
secret, which is why she prays:
she feels guilty about Jerry’s
secret occupation.
That night, Young Jerry sneaks out after his father,
whose “fishing gear” includes a crowbar and ropes.
He follows his father to the grave of Roger Cly, and
watches his father start digging, then runs in terror,
with visions of Cly’s coffin chasing after him.
Jerry is a grave robber! Jerry,
who “fishes” for dead bodies,
represents a perversion of
Jesus, who was described as a
fisher of men. .
The next morning, frustrated that Cly’s body had
been missing, Jerry Cruncher furiously rebukes
his wife for her praying and intervening in the work
of an “honest tradesman.” Later, Young Jerry asks
his father what a “resurrection man” is and says
he would like to be one when he grows up. Jerry is
worried, but also a little proud.
Cly’s missing body will play an
important part in the plot in
later chapters. A “resurrection
man” (grave robber) perverts
the idea of resurrection. Rather
than bringing the dead back to
life, resurrection men sell stolen
body parts to doctors.
Book 2, Chapter 15: Knitting
One day, Monsieur Defarge enters his shop with
the mender of roads and takes him to the attic
with the three “Jacques.” The mender of roads
tells his story: he had watched a man clinging to the
underside of Marquis Evrémonde’s carriage, and
about a year later saw soldiers escort the same man,
who was accused of killing the Marquis, to prison. A
petition to save the man’s life was presented to the
King and Queen, but to no avail. The man was hung
on a gallows above the village fountain. The mender
of roads explains how the corpse cast a long and
frightening shadow.
In presenting a petition, the commoners
are working within the
established political structure:
accepting the nobles as rulers
and making an appeal to their
mercy. But the nobles squander
their chance to show mercy, and
hang the murderer as a warning.
The effect is the opposite: the
dead man’s shadow represents
the commoner’s desire for revenge
and revolution. By showing
no mercy the nobles give up any
chance of receiving any mercy.
Defarge sends the mender of roads outside and
consults with the Jacques. Jacques Three, hungry
for blood, agrees with Defarge that the Marquis’s
castle and the entire Evrémonde race should be
exterminated. Another Jacques points to Madame
Defarge’s knitting, which lists in its stitching the
names of everyone the revolutionaries mean to kill.
Just as the Marquis would
exterminate the people, those
people would exterminate him.
In other words, the revolutionaries
are just as blood-minded as
the corrupt and brutal aristocracy
they seek to overthrow.
Several days later, Monsieur and Madame Defarge
take the mender of roads to Versailles to see a
procession of the King and Queen. The mender of
roads, overwhelmed with excitement, shouts “Long
live the King!” Defarge thanks the man for helping to
keep the aristocrats unaware of the people’s rage.
The mender of roads exemplifies
the fickle mob, who crave spectacle
above all else. One minute
he’s working for the Revolution,
the next he’s overcome with joy
at seeing the king. The Defarges
exploit people like him.
Book 2, Chapter 16: Still Knitting
When the Defarges return home that evening, they
receive information that an Englishman named John
Barsad has been sent to spy on them. Madame
Defarge promises to add his name to her knitting.
Defarge admits to his wife that he’s tired and
doubts the Revolution will come during their lives.
Madame Defarge counters that the Revolution is like
an earthquake: it builds slowly, but when it comes
it releases catastrophic damage. She says she is
content to wait, and will act when necessary.
For all his revolutionary zeal,
Monsieur Defarge also has
some sympathetic human
attributes. Madame Defarge, on
the other hand, is tireless and
merciless. Her comment suggests
just what the Revolution
will be like when it comes: not
a controlled political action with
rational goals defined by political
ideals, but a vengeful riot.
John Barsad enters the shop the next day. In
conversation with the Defarges, Barsad comments
on the plight of the people, trying to get the Defarges
to reveal their revolutionary sympathies. Wise to his
scheme, the Defarges reveal nothing.
John Barsad the spy has already
been spied upon. Suspicion and
surveillance are in full swing.
Barsad changes tactics. Knowing that Defarge was
once Dr. Manette’s servant, he mentions that Lucie
is now married to Charles Darnay—who is in reality
the nephew of the Marquis Evrémonde. After
watching the impact of this news, Barsad leaves.
Because Charles and Lucie bring
together opposite sides of the
French political divide—nobility
and daughter of a revolutionary
hero—their marriage provokes
anger on both sides.
Defarge is in disbelief. He feels a deep anxiety when
Madame Defarge adds Charles’s name to her
knitting.
To Defarge, human connections
still mean something. To Madame
Defarge, all aristocrats
must die, no matter what.

Book 2, Chapter 17: One Night
Lucie spends the last night before her wedding to
Charles with her father. She asks Dr. Manette if he
believes that her marriage will bring them closer. Dr.
Manette assures her that he wants to see her fulfilled,
and couldn’t live with himself otherwise.
Dr. Manette clings to Lucie for
his emotional security. But he
does the noble thing and risks
his mental health in order to
ensure her happiness.
For the first time, Dr. Manette talks to Lucie about
his imprisonment in the Bastille. He tells her that
while there, he passed the time by imagining how his
unborn daughter would grow up. Would she know
nothing about him, or think about her lost father and
weave his memory into the family of her own?
Manette’s thoughts about living
on in his daughter’s memory
after death hint at Carton’s reward
for his sacrifice at the end
of the novel: a legacy carried on
by Lucie’s future family.
Late that night, Lucie sneaks downstairs to check
on her sleeping father. Dr. Manette’s face is deeply
worn from his trials, but he is peacefully asleep.
Manette’s peaceful face is
“imprisoned” in a worn body,
hinting that he won’t be able to
escape his past quite so easily.
Book 2, Chapter 18: Nine Days
On the day of the wedding, Charles Darnay and Dr.
Manette speak privately. When they emerge, Mr.
Lorry notices that Manette looks deathly pale, though
he had looked perfectly normal before the meeting.
Charles has just revealed his
secret to Dr. Manette: he is
an Evrémonde. Somehow this
means something to Manette.
After the wedding, Charles and Lucie leave for their
honeymoon in Wales. The plan is for Dr. Manette to
join the newlyweds after nine days. But after Lucie
leaves, Mr. Lorry notices that Dr. Manette seems
absent-minded. By that evening, Manette is lost and
incoherent, making shoes again in his room. Mr. Lorry
and Miss Pross keep an anxious watch over him, and
decide not to tell Lucie in hopes that Dr. Manette will
improve. He doesn’t improve for nine days.
The discovery that Lucie has
married an Evrémonde pushes
Manette back into his old shoemaking
mania. These events link
the Evrémondes to Manette’s
years in prison, though just
what role the Evrémondes
played in Manette’s imprisonment
remains unclear.
Book 2, Chapter 19: An Opinion
On the tenth day, Mr. Lorry wakes to find Dr. Manette
reading as if nothing has happened. Discovering that
Dr. Manette has no memory of the past nine days,
Mr. Lorry carefully tries to figure out what caused the
relapse by asking Dr. Manette’s opinion about the
medical case of a “friend” who’s daughter Mr. Lorry
cares about. Nonetheless, Manette quickly seems to
suspect what’s going on.
Ever a model of discretion, Mr.
Lorry avoids mentioning anything
that happened directly. Dr.
Manette is still hiding from his
past, even when discussing it.
Mr. Lorry very discreetly describes Dr. Manette’s
situation, never using Manette’s name. He asks what
might have caused the relapse and how he might help
to prevent another one. Dr. Manette replies that it
would be far too painful for the “patient” to tell anyone
his secrets, but surmises that something must have
recently reminded the patient of his past trauma. He
then assures Mr. Lorry that the worst should be over,
and that only something extraordinary could upset
the patient’s mind again.
Dr. Manette represses his
traumas, which remain hidden
until they violently erupt. This
is a metaphor for the French
Revolution itself—the nobles
suppressed the commoners until
a revolt erupted. Dr. Manette
now knows the truth about
Charles’s past, but doesn’t
entirely remember his own.
Mr. Lorry then explains that this “friend” has a
hobby, “blacksmith work,” that may be associated
with the trauma. He wonders if the blacksmith tools
should be removed. Looking worried, Dr. Manette
answers that if manual labor helped the man get
through the trauma, he should be allowed to keep
the tools. Eventually Dr. Manette agrees that the
tools should be removed, but only if these tools are
removed while the patient is elsewhere at the time.
Dr. Manette needs these tools
like a child needs a security
blanket. His inability to face
losing the tools, or even to be
present when they are taken
away, is another example of
Manette’s persistent avoidance
of his traumatic past, whether
conscious or not. But he is still
willing to sacrifice the tools.
That night, after Manette has left to join Lucie and
Charles, Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross remove the
shoemaker’s tools and destroy the bench. Feeling as
guilty as murderers, they burn or bury everything.
Notice how the burying of Dr.
Manette’s work bench parallels
and contrasts with Jerry’s digging
up of dead bodies.
Book 2, Chapter 20: A Plea
The first person to visit Lucie and Charles after they
return from their honeymoon is Sydney Carton.
Carton apologizes for his drunkenness during past
encounters, and asks for Charles’ friendship. Carton
declares himself a worthless man, but says he has a
favor to ask: would Charles mind if he occasionally
visited his house? Of course not, Charles replies.
The novel foreshadows that
Carton, as the first to meet
the married couple, will be
especially important to Charles
and Lucie’s life as a family. For
his part, Charles is just being
polite, humoring Carton out of
his sense of obligation to him.
At dinner that night, Charles comments to Lucie,
Manette, Mr. Lorry, and Miss Pross about Carton‘s
careless and reckless behavior. Later that night in
their room, Lucie suggests that Charles was too
judgmental toward Carton. She asks Charles to have
faith in Carton, who she believes has a wounded heart
but is nevertheless capable of doing tremendous
good. Charles blesses Lucie for her compassion and
promises to have more sympathy for Carton.
Unlike Charles, Lucie has a
deep sympathy and compassion
for Carton’s pitiful soul. Even
though she hardly understands
his behavior, Lucie has faith.
Her prediction about Carton
foreshadows the incredible
sacrifice that Carton will make
for the Manette family.
Book 2, Chapter 21: Echoing Footsteps
Years pass. Lucie weaves her “golden thread”
of positive influence through the family. She often
sits by the parlor window and ponders the echoing
footsteps rising from the street below. She gives birth
to a daughter, Lucie, who particularly likes Sydney
Carton. Her second child, a son, dies in childhood.
As the political situation starts
to unravel in France, Lucie
weaves her domestic community
more tightly together in
London. Her daughter, like her,
has an innocent belief that
Carton is a good man.
In the year 1789, distressing “echoes” arrive from
France. Mr. Lorry confides in Charles that the Paris
office of Tellson’s Bank has been flooded with anxious
aristocrats trying to save their property.
Charles sacrificed his property
to try to escape his family’s
past. Aristocrats who hung on to
their wealth have now lost it.
The scene cuts to Defarge’s wine shop, now the
center of a revolutionary maelstrom. The streets are
thronged with dingy, angry people, armed with guns,
knives, or any weapon they can get their hands on.
The dirty angry revolutionaries
show that the Revolution will
be more about revenge than
Enlightenment ideals.
Defarge leads this army to the Bastille. Madame
Defarge rallies the women, swearing they can kill
as well as the men. After fierce fighting, the Bastille
surrenders and the people swarm inside to free the
prisoners. Defarge and Jacques Three demand
that an older officer show them “One hundred and
five, North Tower.” There, they find Dr. Alexandre
Manette’s initials “A.M.” and search the room.
The taking of the Bastille was
one of the major early events of
the French Revolution. It’s anniversary
is still celebrated as the
French Independence Day. Note
Madame Defarge’s bloodthirstiness.
Manette’s initials on the
wall recall Charles’s story about
the Tower of London.
Returning to the Bastille courtyard, the crowd swarms
the old officer and stabs him to death. Madame
Defarge takes her long knife and slices off his head.
Seven prisoners are freed. Seven prison guards are
killed and their heads are stuck on pikes.
The exchange of the seven
prisoners with seven guards
suggests that power may have
switched sides, but that nothing
has really changed. Madame
Defarge’s beheading of the
guard foreshadows the guillotine.
Book 2, Chapter 22: The Sea Still Rises
Madame Defarge, now the leader of the female
revolutionaries, sits in the wine shop with her
second-in-command, a stocky woman whose violent
acts have earned her the name The Vengeance. No
spies dare come into this neighborhood anymore.
If Madame Defarge represents
Fate, her assistant reveals
exactly 0what kind of Fate
is in store: angry and violent
vengeance in response to years
of tyranny and oppression.
Monsieur Defarge returns with news that an old
aristocrat, who once said that starving people should
just eat grass, tried to fake his own death but has
now been caught. Anger swells—a revolutionary mob
rushes from the neighborhood to the courts building.
The mob overwhelms the officials, captures the old
aristocrat, then drags, beats, and stuffs his mouth with
straw. Finally, they hang him from a lamppost.
The story of the murdered
aristocrat alludes to the famous
story of Queen Marie Antoinette
who, when told that the
starving people had no bread,
replied “Let them eat cake.”
The statement exemplifies cruel
snobbery, but the response is
out of proportion to the offense.
Afterwards, the commoners return home, eat their
“scanty suppers,” play with their kids, and make
love. Back at the shop, Defarge tells his wife that he
is happy the Revolution has finally come. “Almost,”
Madame Defarge replies.
The scenes of the commoners
at home highlights that the
vicious mob is made up of ordinary
people. Madame Defarge’s
comment shows her insatiable
appetite for revenge.

Book 2, Chapter 23: The Fire Rises
While at work in the ruined countryside of France, the
mender of roads encounters a shaggy but powerful
man. Addressing each other as “Jacques,” they
confirm that something will happen “tonight.”
“Jacques” keeps cropping up
everywhere, suggesting how the
revolutionary cause is taken up
again and again by new people.
In the dark courtyard of the castle of Marquis
Evrémonde, four torch-bearing figures appear.
Soon, fire rages through the castle—its stone faces
look tormented and are lost in flame. The inferno
becomes a pillar of fire surging high into the sky.
The stone faces symbolize the
ancient French nobility, which
gets decimated by the Revolution.
The burning castle is a
symbol of the failing aristocracy
and the commoners’ revenge.
A man from the castle rushes into the village
screaming for help to put out the fire and salvage the
valuables in the castle. The crowd of villagers refuses
to budge.
Now the nobility is asking the
people for help, when for so
long they refused to listen to
the people’s appeals for aid.
Later, the villagers surround the house of Monsieur
Gabelle, the government “functionary” in charge of
the area. He is forced to hide on his roof, but is able
to come down in the morning. The narrator explains
that other functionaries in other areas aren’t so lucky,
and that fires are burning all over France.
Though Gabelle is not an
aristocrat himself, he works for
the government. His association
with the aristocrats is enough
for the revolutionaries to distrust
and want to harm him.
Book 2, Chapter 24: Drawn to the Loadstone Rock
It’s now 1792. In the three years that have passed,
there have been battles and bloodshed. The French
nobility has scattered. Many French aristocrats have
become emigrants, fleeing France for London where
they gather at Tellson’s Bank for news.
Though both London and
Paris teetered on the edge of
revolt at the beginning of the
novel, only France has fallen
into revolution.
Inside the bank, Charles is trying to talk Mr. Lorry
out of his latest mission: going to the Paris branch of
the bank to protect whatever bank documents he can.
The aged Mr. Lorry is apparently the youngest clerk at
the bank, and he plans to take Jerry Cruncher for
protection. He will leave that night.
Charles may have democratic
sympathies, but Tellson’s Bank is
invested in old money and aims
to preserve it. This makes Mr.
Lorry’s political and moral positions
in the book ambiguous.
Just then, Mr. Lorry is given a letter addressed to
the “Marquis St. Evrémonde.” Not knowing such a
person, he asks the assembled French nobles. They
declare the man a coward who betrayed his noble
family. Though insulted, Charles does not respond.
Instead, he tells Mr. Lorry that he is an acquaintance
of the Marquis and will deliver the letter.
Although the nobles are wrong
about him, Charles has not
demonstrated to France what
kind of man he is. Because he
ran from his past rather than
confronting it, the nobles and
the commoners despise him.
The letter is from Gabelle. He was arrested, brought
to Paris, and charged with treason for helping an
emigrant, Charles Evrémonde. Gabelle writes that
the peasants neither know nor care that he in fact
was trying to help them, working on Charles’s orders.
He begs Charles to come save his life.
Gabelle was trying to help the
commoners on Charles’s behalf.
But the revolutionaries no longer
care about the truth. They just
want to kill aristocrats. Charles
now gets an opportunity to
restore Gabelle to life.
Charles realizes that he must go to Paris. His sense
of justice obliges him to help Gabelle. He also thinks
he can do something to stop the Revolution’s terrible
violence and urge the people toward mercy. The
narrator describes Charles as being drawn to Paris as
to a Loadstone Rock (a naturally magnetic rock).
Charles wrongly thinks one man
can influence history, or sway
the mob. In fact, the reference
to the magnetic “loadstone”
suggests that even the choice
to return is not really Charles’s
own, that his past has fated him
to go back.
Charles gives Mr. Lorry a reply to send to Gabelle:
Evrémonde will come. Charles packs secretly, writes
a letter each to Lucie and Dr. Manette, and without
telling them leaves for France the following night.
Charles thinks he can do this
on his own, not realizing that
he will also magnetically pull
Lucie and Dr. Manette back to
Paris as well.
Book 3, Chapter 1: In Secret
Charles arrives in France and finds things very
different from when he left. At each village and
checkpoint, he is subjected to the sneering of
revolutionaries dedicated to what the narrator calls
the new republic of “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or
Death.” Charles feels each gate close behind him like
a prison door.
Themes of imprisonment
and fate merge as Charles is
gradually locked into his journey
to Paris. The narrator’s addition
of the words “or death” to the
motto of the Revolution shows
its ideals have been perverted.
Three soldiers accompany Charles to Paris as
his “escort.” Upon arriving in Paris, they deliver
Charles—whom they now call their “prisoner”—to
Monsieur Defarge. Charles demands to know under
what charges he is held, and is told that new laws
against emigrants have been passed. Defarge quietly
asks him why he ever returned to France in this, the
age of “La Guillotine.“ Charles asks Defarge to help
him. Defarge refuses.
As he gets closer to Paris,
Charles goes from free man to
escorted suspect to prisoner,
though he has done nothing.
Defarge refuses to help Charles,
but he shows some sympathy.
The revolutionaries invoke the
guillotine as if it’s a saint: bloodthirsty
violence has replaced
religious compassion.
Defarge conducts Charles to the prison of La Force
with a note for the jailor saying “In secret.” The jail is
full to bursting with aristocrats who welcome Charles
with incredible politeness and sympathize with his
fate. Charles is jailed in a solitary cell in a tower. He
realizes he has been virtually left for dead. Charles
paces off the dimensions of the room again and
again: “five paces by four and a half.”
Defarge helped free Dr.
Manette from his secret
imprisonment, but now Defarge
secretly jails Manette’s son-inlaw.
The Revolution has become
a tyranny. Charles paces to
deal with the isolation of imprisonment,
just as Dr. Manette
turned to making shoes.
Book 3, Chapter 2: The Grindstone
Mr. Lorry arrives at the Paris branch of Tellson’s
Bank. It sits next to the former house of a grand
French noble that has been converted into an armory
for the revolutionaries. In the courtyard there’s a
large grindstone.
The house’s transformation
symbolizes the Revolution:
formerly representing the
excesses of the nobility, now the
house represents the revenge
that excess inspired.
Mr. Lorry is stunned when Lucie and Dr. Manette
rush in. They left London immediately after reading
Charles’s letters. Dr. Manette’s fame as a Bastille
prisoner has granted him access and information,
and he has learned that Charles has been imprisoned
at La Force.
In his return to Paris, Dr.
Manette represents redemption
through suffering. He’s been
restored to his former life, and
suffering has earned him political
power within the Revolution.
Noises outside draw them to the window. Half-naked
men covered in blood are turning the grindstone to
sharpen swords. Frenzied, blood-smeared women
pour wine into the men’s mouths. The mob runs
howling into the streets with their weapons.
The revolutionaries are
described as uncivilized savages,
engaged in some terrible ritual.
Note the wine-blood connection
and the intoxication of violence.
Mr. Lorry whispers to Dr. Manette that the mob
has gone to kill the prisoners at La Force. Horrified,
Manette runs out to the mob. Manette and the
remaining revolutionaries rush to La Force as the mob
cries out, “Help for the Bastille prisoner’s kindred in
La Force!”
It is not enough for the
revolutionaries to imprison their
enemies. They must kill them.
Manette, though, uses the political
power he gained from his
sacrifice to save Charles.
Book 3, Chapter 3: The Shadow
Feeling it necessary to separate Tellson’s Bank from
his own personal business, Mr. Lorry finds an
apartment for Lucie and her family, and leaves Jerry
Cruncher with them to act as guard. On the way
back to Tellson’s Mr. Lorry is stopped by Monsieur
Defarge, who brings news that Charles is safe, a
note for Lucie from Dr. Manette, and instructions for
Lorry to let Defarge in to see Lucie.
Mr. Lorry keeps his two worlds
as separate as possible, but
is deeply committed to both.
It is unclear if Defarge has
tampered with this letter, but
certainly at this moment he is
acting as a secret agent for the
Revolution.
On their way to the apartment, Mr. Lorry and
Defarge are joined by Madame Defarge, who is
knitting, and The Vengeance. Defarge tells Lorry
that, in order to be able to protect Lucie, Madame
Defarge must see and remember Lucie’s face.
That Madame Defarge is
knitting shows that she’s
planning to add Lucie’s name
to her list of victims. “Safety”
and “security” are words the
power-hungry use to mask their
real intentions.
In the apartment, Lucie reads the note from Charles:
he is fine, and under Dr. Manette’s protection.
She gratefully kisses one of Madame Defarge’s
hands, but Madame Defarge coldly withdraws to
her knitting. Lucie pleads for Madame Defarge
to help Charles, to use her influence as a “sisterwoman.”
Madame responds that she has seen so
many women suffering for imprisoned husbands that
Lucie’s predicament doesn’t mean much. After they
leave, Lucie tells Mr. Lorry that Madame Defarge
seems to throw a shadow over all her hopes.
This crucial meeting between
the two key female characters
reveals a lot about each: Lucie
has compassion even for this
terrible woman and asks for
her pity; Madame Defarge
shows she is no “sister-woman”
but is a cold messenger of
death. Madame Defarge is
meant to be a frightening
perversion of femininity, while
Lucie, with her goodness and
compassion, is the model of it.

Book 3, Chapter 4: Calm in the Storm
After four days, Dr. Manette returns. He tells Lorry
that 1100 defenseless prisoners have been murdered,
convicted by a self-appointed Tribunal. The Tribunal
also nearly condemned Charles to death, but Dr.
Manette was able to sway the crowd and Charles was
returned to his cell.
Although Charles’s trial in
England was unfair, the French
Tribunal is depicted as even
more monstrous, a total sham
of justice. Dr. Manette seems
to have brought Charles back
to life.
Dr. Manette has been invigorated by his newfound
authority. He believes his suffering has become
strength and power, capable of breaking Charles
out of prison. Having earned the respect of the
revolutionaries, he has been made the inspecting
physician of a number of prisons, including La Force. In
this new role, he can protect Charles. However, as time
passes, he cannot seem to get Charles freed.
The novel implies that through
suffering comes redemption,
and that faith can empower
people to break the pull of
fate of history. Yet even Dr.
Manette’s political power is not
enough to free Charles.
A year goes by. The Revolution gains in force. The
King and Queen of France are beheaded. As the
revolutionaries grow stronger, their courts zealously
prosecute people, guilty or not. Suspicion reigns. Civil
freedoms disappear.
After the Republic was declared
in France in 1792, the “Reign
of Terror” began: a period of
spying, fear, and escalating
numbers of executions.
The guillotine becomes an institution, and guillotines
can now be found in the streets all over Paris. The
narrator says that in Paris the guillotine has come to
replace the Cross as an idol for worship.
The guillotine, a tool to make
it easier to execute people by
beheading, has become a sacrilegious
idol in place of Christ.
This signals that compassion, in
France, is dead.
Book 3, Chapter 5: The Wood-sawyer
Through it all, Lucie tries to keep a normal English
household to relieve her mind. Dr. Manette reassures
her that he can save Charles. He suggests that she
walk near the prison at a place where Charles might
see her from the window of his cell in order to boost
Charles’s spirits. Lucie does just that, everyday, rain,
shine, or snow.
Lucie fits the classic Victorian
stereotype of female strength
through domesticity (“the angel
in the house”) and selfless
dedication to her husband. Just
as Dr. Manette will unwittingly
doom Charles later, he dooms
Lucie with his advice here.
As Lucie stands at her spot on the street each day,
a wood-sawyer—formerly a mender of roads—
who works nearby always says hello. As he cuts his
wood, the wood-sawyer jokes that he is guillotining a
little family. Though the wood-sawyer unnerves her,
Lucie is always polite and friendly to him.
The mender of roads has
transformed into a man drunk
on the violence of the Revolution.
His sawing represents the
potential executions of Charles,
Lucie, and their daughter.
One snowy day, as Lucie stands outside the prison,
she sees a crowd of people dancing to a popular
revolutionary song. Lucie is horrified by their savage
movements and screams.
Another intense depiction of
revolutionaries as crazed savages
who worship the violence
of the Revolution.
Moments later, Dr. Manette appears. He tells Lucie
that Charles’s trial will be held tomorrow, and
promises her that all will work out well. Lucie kisses
her hand in farewell to Charles as she departs, just
as Madame Defarge comes around the corner.
Manette and Madame Defarge salute each other.
For Lucie, her kiss is a gesture
of love toward her husband.
For Madame Defarge, it’s a
crime of commiserating with an
enemy of the state. But Defarge
is not yet ready to make her
play against Dr. Manette.
Book 3, Chapter 6: Triumph
A rowdy, bloodthirsty crowd gathers for the trial of
“Charles Evrémonde, called Darnay.” Defarge and
Madame Defarge sit in the front row. Madame
Defarge is knitting away. Charles is sentenced
to death as an emigrant, despite the fact that the
law was passed after his imprisonment. The crowd
screams to cut off his head.
This is a court not of justice but
of unchecked political passions.
Charles’s sentence is, in fact,
a travesty of justice—the law
shouldn’t even apply to him.
The crowd does not care about
justice, though. It just wants the
spectacle of his execution.
In his testimony, Charles explains that he actually
isn’t an emigrant: he gave up his aristocratic title and
property, then worked as a French tutor and married
a French woman: Lucie Manette. He says that he
returned to France to save the life of a citizen of the
Republic: Gabelle.
Charles finally explains who
he is to the French people.
By swearing that he is still
a Frenchman, Charles offers
himself as a positive, non-violent
role model for change.
Gabelle, who had been forgotten in prison before the
trial, takes the witness stand and confirms Charles’s
story. Then Dr. Manette testifies, praising Charles’s
character and republican ideals.
Gabelle was left for dead.
Imprisonment is like the grave.
Dr. Manette once again tries
to use political tactics to free
Charles.
The jury votes to acquit Charles. The boisterous
crowd now celebrates Charles as a patriot and carries
him through the streets in celebration.
Charles goes from death row to
a public parade, floating on the
fickle allegiance of the mob.
When she sees Charles, Lucie faints with joy. In their
apartment, she thanks God, then her father, who
declares, “I have saved him.”
Dr. Manette’s political influence
seems to be enough to save
Charles after all.
Book 3, Chapter 7: A Knock at the Door
The next day, Manette remains confident and proud
at having saved Charles, but Lucie continues to fear
for her husband’s safety because so many other
innocent people have been imprisoned and killed. For
safety’s sake, they keep no outside servants, using
only Jerry and Miss Pross. Miss Pross vehemently
and regularly voices her distaste for the French.
Lucie’s worries counter Dr.
Manette’s confidence in his political
power. As Lucie suspects,
everyone in France succumbs to
the Reign of Terror. Miss Pross
embodies the inherent English
distrust of the French.
That afternoon, as Miss Pross and Jerry are out on
errands, Lucie hears footsteps on the stairs outside
the apartment. Then there is a knock at the door. Four
armed revolutionaries enter and declare that Charles
Evrémonde is again the prisoner of the Republic.
In the revolutionary Republic,
laws can change in an instant
as the new people in power
begin to abuse it. The footsteps
in the hall echo the footsteps
Lucie used to hear in England.
Dr. Manette tries to intervene, but the soldiers tell
him that he must make sacrifices if the Revolution
demands it. Still, out of respect for Manette, the men
explain that evidence for the charge comes from
three people: Monsieur and Madame Defarge, and
one other, whom they refuse to name.
The Revolution demands that
the revolutionaries be willing
to sacrifice the lives of others,
even family members, without
question. Manette’s political
power can’t stand up to the
pull of fate and history or to
the Revolution’s all-consuming
desire for blood.
Book 3, Chapter 8: A Hand at Cards
While they’re out on their errands, Miss Pross
screams when she recognizes her brother, Solomon
Pross, disguised as a French republican. Solomon
tells her to be quiet, or else she’ll get him killed. Jerry,
meanwhile, also thinks he recognizes this man, but
can’t quite remember his name.
As an unthinking English patriot,
Miss Pross has never questioned
her brother’s integrity,
but as this chapter will show,
he’s a traitorous opportunist in
an ugly political world.
Sydney Carton, appearing out of nowhere, tells
Jerry the name he is trying to remember: John
Barsad. Having arrived in Paris a day earlier, Carton
explains, Carton chanced upon and recognized
Barsad from Charles Darnay’s English trial. Carton
also learned that Barsad was serving as a French
government spy working in the prisons.
Dickens’s novels are often filled
with extreme coincidences, such
as Carton and Barsad’s sudden
appearances. Though one can
guess that Carton came to
Paris out of concern for Lucie.
Carton and Jerry escort John Barsad to Tellson’s
Bank, where Mr. Lorry also recognizes him. Carton
says he has a plan to help Charles. He then blackmails
Barsad, threatening to reveal him as a spy of the
French government and as a former English spy, both
of which would enrage the revolutionaries. Carton
then reveals that he has seen Barsad associating with
another known English spy: Roger Cly.
Because Carton has nothing to
lose, he can play the dangerous
game of counter-intelligence.
Carton wants to save Charles
in part for Charles’s sake, but
to a larger extent because of
his feelings for Lucie. Recall his
promise to Lucie at the end of
Book 2, Chapter 13.
Barsad grins: Cly is dead, he says. He then takes
out a certificate of burial and says he buried Cly
himself. To everyone’s surprise, Jerry angrily objects
that Barsad had placed “shameful impositions upon
tradesmen,” and then reveals that Cly’s body wasn’t
in his coffin. Barsad realizes he’s caught and agrees
to help. Carton takes him into an adjoining room
to talk.
Jerry’s secret job as a “resurrection
man” saves the day!
But note that it takes being
caught in a lie to get Barsad to
help Charles. There is no honor
among spies. And Barsad has
no concept of sacrificing himself
to a higher cause.

Book 3, Chapter 9: The Game Made
After a while, Barsad leaves and Carton explains
to Mr. Lorry that if Charles is convicted, Barsad
will smuggle Carton into Charles’s cell. Refusing to
explain anything more, Carton asks that Lucie be
told nothing about the plan. He then asks if Mr. Lorry
is satisfied with his long life. Mr. Lorry replies that,
nearing the end, he feels closer again to his life’s
beginning. Carton says he knows the feeling. Mr.
Lorry gains a new respect for Carton.
Carton’s exchange with Lorry
suggests that Carton plans to
sacrifice himself and expects
to die. As always, he works for
other people without taking
credit, but this time he works
for a greater cause. Mr. Lorry’s
sense of returning to the beginning
takes on a religious tone
with Carton: he will be reborn
in heaven.
Carton visits a pharmacy and buys a mysterious
packet of drugs that the chemist warns are very
potent. All night, Carton wanders the streets of Paris.
As he walks, he remembers a prayer the priest spoke
at his father’s funeral: “I am the resurrection and the
life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he
were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and
believeth in me, shall never die.”
The prayer Carton remembers
comes from the story of Jesus
and Lazarus, whom Jesus
resurrects in the Bible (John
11:25). The line says that Jesus
will resurrect and give eternal
life not only to Lazarus, but to
anyone who believes in him.
As he continues to walk, he encounters a young girl,
whom he helps across the street. She kisses him, and
once more Carton remembers the prayer.
Carton is showing compassion
to others, and receiving blessings
(the kiss) in return.
Carton arrives at the courthouse the next morning
for Charles’s trial, where Jacques Three is the
head of the jury. As the trial begins, the prosecutor
announces who brought the charges: Defarge,
Madame Defarge, and Dr. Alexandre Manette.
Like the wood-sawyer, Jacques
Three enjoys political executions.
As in Charles’s first trial,
Manette is again forced by
fate and history to serve as a
witness for the prosecution.
The court erupts in chaos. Manette objects that he
never denounced Charles. The judge silences him.
Defarge then takes the stand and explains how,
during the storming of the Bastille, he searched
Manette’s old cell and found a letter hidden in the
chimney. The judge asks that it be read aloud.
Manette’s hidden letter recalls
Charles’s story about the Tower
of London. It represents all
the trauma and revenge that
Dr. Manette has repressed,
consciously or unconsciously.
Book 3, Chapter 10: The Substance of the Shadow
Defarge explains that Dr. Manette wrote the letter
while in the Bastille to explain how he ended up in
prison. He then reads the letter. Walking home one
night in 1757, Dr. Manette was taken into a carriage
by two men, identical twins. From their coat of arms,
he learned that they were Evrémondes: Charles’s
father (who was then the Marquis) and his uncle (who
became the Marquis after Charles’s father died, and
was murdered in Book 2, Chapter 9).
The letter tells the story of
Manette’s imprisonment. The
twin Evrémonde brothers
epitomize the selfishness and
cruelty of aristocratic power.
They take what they want,
when they want, by whatever
means necessary.
The men took the doctor to see two patients: one,
a beautiful young woman deliriously calling out for
her family, and the other, a peasant boy with a stab
wound in his chest. As Manette treated the boy,
the boy told him that the young woman was his
sister. After she married, the two aristocrats decided
they wanted her for themselves. So they forced her
husband to endure impossibly hard work until he
died. Then they took her away and raped her.
The Evrémondes don’t
recognize the individual rights
of peasants, the sovereignty of
marriage, or the sacredness
of female sexuality, which was
a huge deal in Dickens’s time.
They are the worst example
of aristocratic tyranny, and, as
such, they embody many of
the reasons the commoners
revolted.
The peasant boy and young woman’s father died
upon hearing the news. The boy then sent his
younger sister to a distant, secret place, and, seeking
revenge, snuck into the Evrémondes’ castle. He
confronted one of the Evrémondes, who stabbed
him. The boy soon died, but before he did he cursed
the Evrémondes by marking the air with a cross of his
own blood. The young woman died within a week.
The nobles then offered Dr. Manette some gold in
return for his silence, but he declined and returned
home, disgusted with all he had seen.
The curse seals the fate of the
Evrémonde brothers. While
Charles did not know this story,
he sensed his family’s dark
past when he renounced it in
Book 2, Chapter 9. Dr. Manette
refused to be bought off by the
Evrémondes, despite the danger
of such an action. He sacrificed
his freedom to preserve his
integrity.
The next day, the wife of the Marquis (and Charles’s
mother) visited Dr. Manette. Hearing what had
happened, she hoped to find and help the surviving
sister of the abused peasant family. She told her little
boy Charles that he must someday repay this injured
girl. Unfortunately, Manette didn’t know where the
girl was.
That surviving sister, as future
events in the novel will show,
is Madame Defarge. Ironically,
Charles has pledged himself to
help this girl, while she blindly
seeks revenge and does everything
in her power to kill him.
Dr. Manette soon sent a letter to the authorities
detailing the crimes of the Evrémonde brothers.
But the Marquis intercepted and burned Manette’s
letter. He then sent Manette in secret to the Bastille.
Manette ends his letter from prison with a curse on
the Evrémondes.
Manette tried to condemn
the Evrémondes officially and
failed—just as he does now,
having tried to use his political
influence to save Charles. Both
governments are corrupt. His
curse seals Charles’s fate.
Incensed at the actions of the Evrémondes, the jury
sentences Charles to death. The crowd goes wild.
Just days before the crowd
cheered Charles as a patriot.
Book 3, Chapter 11: Dusk
As the crowd celebrates Charles’s conviction in the
streets, John Barsad, who is escorting Charles back
to his cell, lets Lucie her embrace her husband for
the last time. Charles says farewell and asks her to
kiss their daughter. Lucie tells him she feels that they
will not be long separated and will meet in heaven.
Lucie has some kind of serene
connection to the next world.
If their love isn’t possible in
the world, it will be renewed
in heaven. Note how well
positioned Barsad is to smuggle
Carton into Charles’s cell.
Devastated, Dr. Manette tries to apologize to
Charles. But Charles stops him, and instead thanks
him, acknowledging all that Dr. Manette must have
suffered to offer his own daughter back into the
Evrémonde family he justifiably hates.
Like Dr. Manette, Charles also
had a horrific secret past, of
which he was unaware, come
back to haunt him. He cannot
escape the curse on his family.
Lucie faints. Carton carries her to a carriage and
escorts her home. There, he instructs Dr. Manette
to use any remaining influence to try to save Charles.
Dr. Manette hurries away. However, once he’s gone,
Carton and Mr. Lorry confess they have no hope.
Carton is just distracting Dr.
Manette; he knows that politics
are no longer of any use.
Something stronger is necessary
to break the grip of fate, history,
and the Revolution.
Lucie’s daughter begs Carton to help. Carton
embraces her and, before he leaves, kisses the
unconscious Lucie and whispers, “A life you love.”
As his farewell implies, Carton’s
goal is to give Lucie and her
family a happy life. He is willing
to sacrifice himself for that.
Book 3, Chapter 12: Darkness
Sydney Carton decides to make sure he is seen
around Paris. He eventually wanders into a wine
shop—Defarge’s wine shop. Defarge and Madame
Defarge marvel at his physical resemblance to
Charles, but have no idea who he is.
Carton wants to make sure
that it is known that there is
someone who looks just like
Darnay walking free on the
streets of Paris.
Carton eavesdrops on a conversation between
Defarge, Madame Defarge, The Vengeance, and
Jacques Three, in which Madame Defarge plots to
exterminate the Evrémonde line—including Lucie and
Lucie’s daughter. She says that she and the woodsawyer
will testify against Lucie for sympathizing
with a prisoner. Jacques Three promises a conviction.
Monsieur Defarge, however, hesitates, and suggests
that poor Dr. Manette has suffered enough.
The bloodthirsty juries of
the Revolution need only the
slightest suspicion to convict
someone. Jacques Three’s promise
indicates that there is no
justice, and that the trials are
shams. Monsieur Defarge’s pity
for Manette makes Madame
Defarge’s utter mercilessness
stand out even more starkly.
Madame Defarge responds by revealing her history
with the Evrémondes: she is the missing sister of
the peasant family whom the Evrémonde brothers
abused and killed. She vows to carry out her brother’s
dying curse. She barks at Defarge that he can tell
wind and fire where to stop, “but don’t tell me.”
Jacques Three and The Vengeance are thrilled.
Madame Defarge exceeds the
forces of nature. She is a the
terrifying product of tyrannous
cruelty. She symbolizes all
of the people abused by the
aristocrats, and her vengeance
is the embodiment of the
Revolution.
Carton hurries home. Soon, Dr. Manette returns
too, begging for his shoemaker’s bench. Shocked,
Carton and Mr. Lorry realize that Dr. Manette has
lost his mind. Carton instructs Mr. Lorry to gather
everyone’s passports, including Carton’s, and leave
the next day before Madame Defarge’s accusations
make it impossible for them to leave France. Then
Carton says farewell, blesses Lucie, and leaves.
A key tipping point: the curse
against Charles cannot be
stopped, and Dr. Manette’s
insanity is now permanent. After
failing to save Charles, Manette
reverts to his own fate as a
traumatized prisoner. Carton
takes control of things, setting
up his final plan.

Book 3, Chapter 13: Fifty-two
In the prison, 52 people, including Charles, await
execution that day. Charles writes a final letter to
Lucie, in which he says that he did not know about
her father’s history and that he believes Dr. Manette
was unaware of his damning letter. Charles writes
much the same to Dr. Manette. He also writes to Mr.
Lorry, but never thinks to write to Carton.
Neither Charles nor Dr.
Manette were aware of their
real legacies. The don’t control
their own destinies. Charles
has underestimated Carton
before. The fact that Carton is
under no obligation to make
his sacrifice only increases its
symbolic power.
Suddenly John Barsad opens the cell door and lets in
Carton. Carton tells Charles to start changing clothes
with him. Then Carton dictates a letter for Charles to
write, in which he asks “someone” to remember him
and is grateful to have the chance to prove himself.
In Book 2, Chapter 4 Carton
envied Charles. Now he
becomes Charles by literally
sacrificing his identity to save
Charles’s life. The “someone” in
the letter is Lucie.
As Charles writes, Carton waves the packet of drugs
under his nose. Charles passes out. Carton finishes
swapping their clothes and Barsad carries Charles,
now disguised as Sydney Carton, back to Mr. Lorry.
Charles has been helpless to
stop history, and is not just passive,
but actually unconscious,
during his escape.
Soon the guards arrive and take Carton, whom they
think is Charles Evrémonde, out to join the other
condemned prisoners. A young woman, who was
wrongly accused and convicted, asks him if she can
hold his hand. Suddenly, the women realizes that
he is not Evrémonde. “Are you dying for him?” she
asks. “And his wife and child,” Carton replies. Carton
promises to hold the woman’s hand until the end.
The young girl reveals how
corrupt and merciless the
republic’s tribunals are. Her innocence
also lets her recognize
Carton for who he is: a figure
of Christ, giving his life to save
others. Holding Carton’s hand
suggests how the girl’s faith will
sustain her.
At the Paris barricade, guards check the papers of the
passengers in a carriage: Mr. Lorry, Dr. Manette,
Lucie, and “Sydney Carton,” who is unconscious.
They wave the carriage through.
Just as Mr. Lorry smuggled the
infant Lucie out of Paris, he now
transports these mostly helpless
passengers to safety.
Book 3, Chapter 14: The Knitting Done
At the shop of the wood-sawyer, Madame Defarge
holds a secret conference with Jacques Three and The
Vengeance. Madame says that she no longer trusts
Monsieur Defarge, and that they must exterminate
the Evrémondes themselves. Jacques Three swears
that his jury will condemn Lucie, and fantasizes about
the blond hair and blue eyes of Lucie’s beheaded child
at the guillotine. The wood-sawyer and Madame
Defarge promise to testify against Lucie.
Lucie kissed her hand to
the prison as a gesture of
loyalty and compassion. But the
revolutionaries see it as an act
of treason. The revolutionaries
have given up all human feeling
and mercy, as is shockingly
apparent in Jacques Three’s sick
fantasy about murdering an
innocent girl.
Madame Defarge strides through the streets like
a tigress, a woman without pity, armed with a knife
and loaded pistol. She heads to Lucie’s apartment,
hoping to strengthen her case by catching Lucie
insulting the Revolution in her grief.
Madame Defarge combines the
figures of Fate and Death. She
is terrifying and inhuman. She
represents death as opposed to
resurrection, murder as opposed
to sacrifice.
At the apartment, Jerry Cruncher and Miss Pross
get ready to leave in their own carriage. Jerry swears
that he will give up grave robbing, and states that his
opinions about praying have changed. He adds that
he hopes Mrs. Cruncher is praying right then.
Jerry gives up his work as a
“resurrection man” because
that job belongs to Christ. With
death (Madame Defarge) on
the move, Jerry turns to religion
to save him.
Jerry leaves to make arrangements. Soon after,
Madame Defarge arrives at the apartment and
demands that Miss Pross let her see Lucie. Miss
Pross refuses to budge from Lucie’s bedroom door.
Madame Defarge tries to shove her aside, but
Miss Pross grabs her. During the ensuing struggle,
Madame Defarge grabs for her pistol. But as she
grabs the weapon it accidentally goes off, killing her.
Miss Pross flees the apartment in terror. She meets
up with Jerry and discovers that she has permanently
lost her hearing.
Lucie kissed Madame Defarge’s
hands and asked for mercy.
That failed. Now, the faithful
English servant Miss Pross
wrestles with a faithless French
former servant turned revolutionary.
Madame Defarge’s accidental
suicide shows how the
revolutionaries sow the seeds of
their own destruction. In fact, as
the Reign of Terror progressed,
many French revolutionaries
died under their own guillotines.
Book 3, Chapter 15: The Footstep Die Out Forever
Three carts rumble through the Paris streets carrying
the condemned prisoners to the guillotine. Some
onlookers, used to the spectacle, are bored. Others
gather to see Charles Evrémonde and insult him.
This alludes to Christ’s journey
to the crucifixion, during which
Christ was also harassed and
insulted by spectators.
The Vengeance is in the crowd. She has been saving
a front-row seat for Madame Defarge and holding
her knitting. She bitterly regrets that her friend will
miss the festivities.
Madame Defarge is separated
from her knitting: the grip of
fate has been broken.
The young woman is scheduled to be beheaded
by the guillotine just before Carton. She thanks
Carton for helping her stay composed, and says he
must have been sent to her from Heaven. Carton
tells her to focus only on him and to have no fear.
When her time comes, they kiss, and she calmly
goes to the guillotine. Carton is next. He says “I am
the resurrection and the life.” Carton ascends the
platform, his face looking serene and prophetic, and
the guillotine crashes down on his head.
As Christ comforted his fellow
prisoners on the cross, Carton
also comforts the girl, urging
her to look past the suffering of
politics toward a heavenly future.
With such faith, the condemned
have no fear. Carton’s prayer
suggests that they will live
forever. His serene face implies
the certainty of his salvation
and resurrection, brought about
through faith.
The narrator describes Carton’s final thoughts. He
recognizes that Barsad, The Vengeance, and all
the “new oppressors” will die by the guillotine they
now celebrate. Yet he is also sure that Paris will rise
up from its ashes, struggling to be free. He sees a
vision of Lucie with a new son, named after him,
who will live a successful and prosperous life. He also
sees Dr. Manette restored to health, and Mr. Lorry
leaving all his considerable wealth to the Manette’s
and then passing tranquilly away. And Carton knows
he is blessed and treasured by all these people. The
novel ends with Carton’s final thoughts, “It is a far, far
better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far,
far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.”
In Carton’s vision, the revolutionaries
who showed no mercy
will not receive any, just like the
aristocracy before them. The
novel makes the case for mercy,
in particular Christian mercy, as
a vital force to counteract the
tendency of the powerful toward
tyranny, and suggests that
France will eventually find this
balance. For his selfless sacrifice,
which alone could break the
grip of fate and history, Carton
is resurrected not just in heaven
but also through Lucie’s son,
who lives out Lucie’s hope that
Carton would live a better life.

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the
age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch
of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season
of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of
hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before
us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to
Heaven, we were all going direct the other way.
Book 1, Chapter 3 Quotes
A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is
constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every
other. A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by
night, that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses
its own secret; that every room in every one of them
encloses its own secret; that every beating heart in the hundreds
of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings,
a secret to the heart nearest it!
Book 1, Chapter 5 Quotes
The children had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon
them, and upon the grown faces, and ploughed into every
furrow of age and coming up afresh, was the sign, Hunger. It
was prevalent everywhere. Hunger was pushed out of the tall
houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and
lines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and
wood and paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of
the small modicum of firewood that the man sawed off; Hunger
stared down from the smokeless chimneys, and started
up from the filthy street that had no offal, among its refuse,
of anything to eat. Hunger was the inscription on the baker’s
shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of bad
bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation
that was offered for sale.
Book 1, Chapter 6 Quotes
If you hear in my voice … any resemblance to a voice that
once was sweet music in your ears, weep for it, weep for it! If
you touch, in touching my hair, anything that recalls a beloved
head that lay on your breast when you were young and free,
weep for it, weep for it! If, when I hint to you of a Home that
is before us, where I will be true to you with all my duty and
with all my faithful service, I bring back the remembrance of a
Home long desolate, while your poor heart pined away, weep
for it, weep for it! — Lucie Manette
Book 2, Chapter 2 Quotes
The sort of interest with which this man was stared and
breathed at, was not a sort that elevated humanity … The
form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled,
was the sight; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered
and torn asunder, yielded the sensation. Whatever gloss
the various spectators put upon the interest, according to
their several arts and powers of self-deceit, the interest was,
at the root of it, Ogreish.

Book 2, Chapter 4 Quotes
Only his daughter had the power of charming this black
brooding from his mind. She was the golden thread that united
him to a Past beyond his misery, and to a Present beyond
his misery: and the sound of her voice, the light of her face,
the touch of her hand, had a strong beneficial influence with
him almost always.
Book 2, Chapter 5 Quotes
Waste forces within him, and a desert all around, this man
stood still on his way across a silent terrace, and saw for
a moment, lying in the wilderness before him, a mirage of
honourable ambition, self-denial, and perseverance. In the
fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries from which the
loves and graces looked upon him, gardens in which the fruits
of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his sight.
A moment, and it was gone. Climbing to a high chamber in a
well of houses, he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected
bed, and its pillow was wet with wasted tears.
Book 2, Chapter 7 Quotes
But, the comfort was, that all the company at the grand hotel
of Monseigneur were perfectly dressed. If the Day of Judgment
had only been ascertained to be a dress day, everybody there
would have been eternally correct. Such frizzling and powdering
and sticking up of hair, such delicate complexions artificially
preserved and mended, such gallant swords to look at, and
such delicate honour to the sense of smell, would surely keep
anything going, for ever and ever. … with the rustle of silk and
brocade and fine linen, there was a flutter in the air that fanned
Saint Antoine and his devouring hunger far away.
Book 2, Chapter 8 Quotes
Expressive signs of what made them poor, were not wanting;
the tax for the state, the tax for the church, the tax for the lord,
tax local and tax general, were to be paid here and to be paid
there, according to solemn inscription in the little village, until
the wonder was, that there was any village left unswallowed.
Book 2, Chapter 9 Quotes
“Repression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference
of fear and slavery, my friend,” observed the Marquis,
“will keep the dogs obedient to the whip, as long as this roof,”
looking up to it, “shuts out the sky.”
Book 2, Chapter 10 Quotes
He had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his danger. He
had never heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of
her compassionate voice; he had never seen a face so tenderly
beautiful, as hers when it was confronted with his own
on the edge of the grave that had been dug for him.
Book 2, Chapter 13 Quotes
For you, and for any dear to you, I would do anything. If my
career were of that better kind that there was any opportunity
or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would embrace any sacrifice for
you and for those dear to you. Try to hold me in your mind, at
some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one thing. The
time will come, the time will not be long in coming, when new
ties will be formed about you […] O Miss Manette, […] when
you see your own bright beauty springing up anew at your feet,
think now and then that there is a man who would give his life,
to keep a life you love beside you! — Sydney Carton
Book 2, Chapter 16 Quotes
Another darkness was closing in as surely, when the church
bells, then ringing pleasantly in many an airy steeple over
France, should be melted into thundering cannon; when the
military drums should be beating to drown a wretched voice,
that night all potent as the voice of Power and Plenty, Freedom
and Life. So much was closing in about the women who
sat knitting, knitting, that they their very selves were closing
in around a structure yet unbuilt, where they were to sit knitting,
knitting, counting dropping heads.
Book 2, Chapter 18 Quotes
Nothing would induce him to speak more. He looked up, for
an instant at a time, when he was requested to do so; but, no
persuasion would extract a word from him. He worked, and
worked, and worked, in silence, and words fell on him as they
would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on the air.
Book 2, Chapter 20 Quotes
My husband, it is so. I fear he is not to be reclaimed; there
is scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes
is reparable now. But, I am sure that he is capable of good
things, gentle things, even magnanimous things. – Lucie
Book 2, Chapter 21 Quotes
The sea of black and threatening waters, and of destructive
upheaving of wave against wave, whose depths were yet unfathomed
and whose forces were yet unknown. The remorseless
sea of turbulently swaying shapes, voices of vengeance,
and faces hardened in the furnaces of suffering until the
touch of pity could make no mark on them.
Book 2, Chapter 22 Quotes
The raggedest nightcap, awry on the wretchedest head, had
this crooked significance in it: “I know how hard it has grown
for me, the wearer of this, to support life in myself; but do
you know how easy it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to
destroy life in you?” Every lean bare arm, that had been without
work before, had this work always ready for it now, that it
could strike. The fingers of the knitting women were vicious,
with the experience that they could tear.
Book 2, Chapter 23 Quotes
With the rising and falling of the blaze, the stone faces
showed as if they were in torment. When great masses of
stone and timber fell, the face with the two dints in the nose
became obscured: anon struggled out of the smoke again, as
if it were the face of the cruel Marquis, burning at the stake
and contending with the fire.
Book 2, Chapter 24 Quotes
Like the mariner in the old story, the winds and streams had
driven him within the influence of the Loadstone Rock, and
it was drawing him to itself, and he must go. Everything that
arose before his mind drifted him on, faster and faster, more
and more steadily, to the terrible attraction. His latent uneasiness
had been … that he who could not fail to know that he
was better than they, was not there, trying to do something to
stay bloodshed, and assert the claims of mercy and humanity.
Book 3, Chapter 1 Quotes
Not a mean village closed upon him, not a common barrier
dropped across the road behind him, but he knew it to be
another iron door in the series that was barred between him
and England. The universal watchfulness so encompassed
him, that if he had been taken in a net, or were being forwarded
to his destination in a cage, he could not have felt his
freedom more completely gone.
Book 3, Chapter 2 Quotes
As these ruffians turned and turned, their matted locks now
flung forward over their eyes, now flung backward over their
necks, some women held wine to their mouths that they
might drink; and what with dropping blood, and what with
dropping wine, and what with the stream of sparks struck out
of the stone, all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and
fire. The eye could not detect one creature in the group free
from the smear of blood.
Book 3, Chapter 4 Quotes
Above all, one hideous figure grew … the figure of the sharp
female called La Guillotine. It was the popular theme for jests; it
was the best cure for headache, it infallibly prevented the hair
from turning grey, it imparted a peculiar delicacy to the complexion,
it was the National Razor which shaved close: who kissed
La Guillotine, looked through the little window and sneezed into
the sack. It was the sign of the regeneration of the human race.
It superseded the Cross. Models of it were worn on breasts from
which the Cross was discarded, and it was bowed down to and
believed in where the Cross was denied.
Book 3, Chapter 5 Quotes
No fight could have been half so terrible as this dance. It was
so emphatically a fallen sport—a something, once innocent,
delivered over to all devilry—a healthy pastime changed into
a means of angering the blood, bewildering the senses, and
steeling the heart. Such grace as was visible in it, made it the
uglier, showing how warped and perverted all things good by
nature were become.
Book 3, Chapter 6 Quotes
Looking at the Jury and the turbulent audience, he might have
thought that the usual order of things was reversed, and that
the felons were trying the honest men.
Book 3, Chapter 8 Quotes
Miss Pross recalled soon afterwards, and to the end of her
life remembered, that as she pressed her hands on Sydney’s
arm and looked up in his face, imploring him to do no hurt to
Solomon, there was a braced purpose in the arm and a kind
of inspiration in the eyes, which not only contradicted his light
manner, but changed and raised the man.
Book 3, Chapter 9 Quotes
“I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that
believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and
whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die.”
Before that unjust Tribunal, there was little or no order of procedure,
ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing.
There could have been no such Revolution, if all laws,
forms, and ceremonies, had not first been so monstrously
abused, that the suicidal vengeance of the Revolution was to
scatter them all to the winds.
Book 3, Chapter 10 Quotes
The boy’s eyes, which had been fixed on mine, slowly turned
to the looker-on, and I saw in the two faces that all he said
was true. The two opposing kinds of pride confronting one
another, I can see, even in this Bastille; the gentleman’s, all
negligent indifference; the peasants, all trodden-down sentiment,
and passionate revenge. — Dr. Manette
Book 3, Chapter 14 Quotes
There were many women at that time, upon whom the time
laid a dreadfully disfiguring hand; but, there was not one
among them more to be dreaded than this ruthless woman,
now taking her way along the streets … imbued from her
childhood with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate
hatred of a class, opportunity had developed her into a
tigress. She was absolutely without pity.
Book 3, Chapter 15 Quotes
Along the Paris streets, the death-carts rumble, hollow and
harsh. Six tumbrils carry the day’s wine to La Guillotine. All the
devouring and insatiate Monsters imagined since imagination
could record itself, are fused in the one realisation, Guillotine.
… Crush humanity out of shape once more, under similar hammers,
and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms. Sow
the same seed of rapacious license and oppression over again,
and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind.

Sun ONE Application Server 7, Enterprise Edition documentation is located on the
documentation CD that accompanies the product.
Installation Components
The Sun ONE Application Server Version 7, Enterprise Edition product is made up
of the following software components that work together to create the Application
Server platform:
• Application Server
• Administration Client
• Sun ONE Message Queue
• Java 2 Software Development Kit (J2SE)
• Sample Applications
• Always-On Technology Components
Application Server
This component includes the core components of the Sun ONE Application Server
software and is dependent on the J2SE component. Refer to What’s New and the
Product Overview documents for a more in-depth explanation of the features of Sun
ONE Application Server 7, Enterprise Edition.
Administration
The Administration interface and the command-line interface are automatically
installed when you install the Application Server component. When the
Administration interface has been started, the initial page of the Application Server
graphical interface is displayed.
• Admin Server—Provides administration facilities (one Admin Server per
domain).
• Administration interface—Graphical interface used for performing server
administration tasks. Also called the Admin Console.
Installation Components
18 Sun ONE Application Server Version 7, Enterprise Edition Installation Guide • September 2003
• Command-line interface—Performs the same tasks as the Administration
interface. A number of high-availability commands are available with this
release. Refer to the Application Server Administrator’s Guide for instructions on
using these commands.
• Multiple administrative domains—This mechanism allows different
administrators to create and manage their own sets of application server
instances.
Both the graphical and command-line administration clients allow you to manage
and configure your servers and the applications hosted on them, as well as help
you deploy your applications.
Full instructions for using the administration tools are contained in the Sun ONE
Application Server Administrator’s Guide, the Administration interface online help,
and the asadmin and hadbm man pages.
Administration Client
The administration client is the separate command-line component of the
Application Server. It is installed automatically when the Sun ONE Application
Server component is installed and is dependent on the J2SE component.
You can choose to install the command-line version of this client separately on a
machine where the Application Server is not installed. Do this by selecting the Sun
ONE Administration Client component instead of the Sun ONE Application Server
component during installation.
Java 2 Software Development Kit (J2SE)
The Sun ONE Application Server product requires the J2SE 1.4.1_03 and leverages
the performance and feature improvements that are part of the 1.4 platform.
During an installation, you can choose to reuse a J2SE component that is already
installed on your system as long as the J2SE version is correct.
NOTE The Sun ONE Application Server 7 product is only certified to work
with J2SE 1.4.1_03 from Sun Microsystems. Third-party J2SE
development kits, even with appropriate version numbers, are not
supported.
Installation Components
Chapter 1 Preparing to Install 19
The J2SE is installed here by default: /usr/j2se
Sun ONE Message Queue
The Sun ONE Message Queue, Platform Edition software is a production
implementation of the Java Messaging Service (JMS) 1.0.2 specification. It is
automatically installed when you install the Application Server software.
The Platform Edition of Sun ONE Message Queue differs from the Enterprise
Edition in that Platform Edition does not have the following Message Queue
features:
• Support for multi-broker message services
• HTTP/HTTPS connections
• Secure connection services
• Scalable connection capability
• Multiple queue delivery policies
For further information, the Sun ONE Message Queue has its own documentation
set that can be found at the following location:

More information about the samples can be found here:
install_dir/samples/index.html
Always-On Technology Components
The Sun ONE Application Server 7, Enterprise Edition includes the Always-On
Technology, which supports multi-tiered, multi-machine, clustered application
server deployments. In Enterprise Edition, the web tier supports load balancing
and application traffic partitioning using a web server plug-in.
Various topologies for the Always On Technology are discussed in the Sun ONE
Application Server System Deployment Guide. For instructions on configuring and
administering high availability for the Application Server, refer to the Sun ONE
Application Server Administrator’s Guide.
The following installation components provide the basis for the Always-On
Technology:
• High-Availability Database (HADB)
• HADB Management Client
• Load Balancer Plug-in
High-Availability Database (HADB)
The Application Server provides a transactional, highly-available and
highly-scalable session state persistence infrastructure. Application Server uses the
HADB to store session information.
For additional information on this component, refer to the HADB Configuration
chapter in the Sun ONE Application Server Administrator’s Guide.
HADB Management Client
The HADB management client is the command-line interface for the HADB. A full
set of utilities is available for performing HADB configuration, runtime
management, and monitoring.
Instructions for using the utilities are contained in the Sun ONE Application Server
Administrator’s Guide, the hadbm man pages, and the asadmin session persistence
man pages.
Installation Methodology
Chapter 1 Preparing to Install 21
Load Balancer Plug-in
The load balancer is responsible for taking incoming HTTP requests and
distributing them across the instances in the cluster. The load balancer also makes
it possible for sessions to fail over to new instances when an instance becomes
unavailable, and for a user to quiesce an instance prior to taking it offline.
The Application Server high-availability load balancer plug-in is an enhanced
version of the HTTP reverse proxy plug-in. In addition, third-party load balancers
can be used. This component is dependent on a pre-installed web server.
Supported web servers are listed in the Sun ONE Application Server Platform
Summary.
For additional information on this component, refer to “Installing the Load
Balancer Plug-in” on page 44 and the Configuring Load Balancing in the Sun ONE
Application Server Administrator’s Guide.
Installation Methodology
The Sun ONE Application Server can be installed or uninstalled using the
command-line interface or the graphical interface. You can install interactively
using either the graphical or command-line interfaces, or you can use silent mode
to replicate an installation scenario on one or multiple machines.
Partial and incremental (subsequent) installations are supported. Using either of
the interactive methods, you can do a partial installation which can be followed by
any number of incremental installations. For silent mode, you can do a partial
initial installation, but any subsequent installations must be done using an
interactive method.
The installation program or uninstallation program checks for component
dependencies and does not allow you to install or uninstall components without
their dependent components.
The following sections explain the various installation methods:
• Graphical Interface Method
• Command-Line Interface Method
• Silent Mode
Installation Methodology
22 Sun ONE Application Server Version 7, Enterprise Edition Installation Guide • September 2003
Graphical Interface Method
If you choose to use the graphical interface for installation, you are provided with a
set of interactive graphical dialogs.
To invoke the installation program using the graphical (default) method:
./setup
To invoke the uninstallation program using the graphical (default) method:
./uninstall
Command-Line Interface Method
If you choose to the use the command-line interface, the installation steps are the
same as for the graphical-interface installation, but a graphics-capable display is
not provided.
To invoke the installation program using the command-line method:
./setup -console
To invoke the uninstallation program using the command-line method:
./uninstall -console
If you are using Telnet to access a remote server, you can use the command-line
interface to install the product in an interactive fashion.
Silent Mode
You can use silent mode to perform a scripted installation based on the presence of
a parameter file that was created during an interactive installation. In silent mode,
the Application Server software is installed or uninstalled without any interaction
with you. By referring to the installation configuration file, the components that
were installed or uninstalled in the interactive model are automatically installed or
uninstalled on one or multiple servers.
NOTE For a hardened Solaris operating environment, you must use the
command-line method. To start the installation program in a
hardened environment, you will need to perform the steps in
“Hardened Solaris Operating Environment Requirement” on
page 26.
Distribution of the Product
Chapter 1 Preparing to Install 23
Instructions for using silent mode are contained in “Installing in Silent Mode
(Non-Interactive)” on page 48 and “Uninstalling in Silent Mode (non-interactive)”
on page 90.

26 Sun ONE Application Server Version 7, Enterprise Edition Installation Guide • September 2003
Solaris 8 Patch Requirements
For Solaris 8 systems, the following Solaris patches must be installed:
• 109326-06
• 108827-26
• 110934-02
These patches are available individually from the patch finder page here:
http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/show.pl?target=patches/patch-access
Shared Message Queue Broker Requirement
If your machine has an active installation of the Solaris 9 bundled version of the
Application Server software, and you install the unbundled version of the server,
the Message Queue broker for these application server installations will be shared.
Therefore, if you fail to uniquely name your domains and instances, you may
receive the following errors when starting up the second instance with the same
domain or instance name:
SEVERE: JMS5024: JMS service startup failed
SEVERE: CORE5071: An error occured during initialization
To avoid these errors, see JMS Support in the Sun ONE Application Server
Administrator’s Guide.
Hardened Solaris Operating Environment Requirement
Hardening means customizing existing services or functions so as to improve the
overall security of the platform. The hardening process generally includes tasks
such as disabling unnecessary services, strengthening ownership and permissions
on objects, and enabling miscellaneous security functions such as non-default
logging and auditing. A hardened operating system usually doesn't allow
GUI-based applications to be run in the environment.
NOTE Solaris 8 systems should have the “Sun recommended patch cluster”
installed. The patch cluster includes the three required patches listed
in this section and is available under “Recommended and Security
Patches” here:
http://sunsolve.sun.com/
Installation Requirements
Chapter 1 Preparing to Install 27
The following two libraries are required to install and use Sun ONE Application
Server 7, Enterprise Edition in a hardened Solaris operating environment:
• libC.so.5
• libCrun.so.1
These libraries can be obtained by installing the SUNWlibC (Sun Workshop
Compilers Bundled libC) package which is part of the Solaris distribution in the
end-user package cluster (not in the core).
General Requirements
The following additional requirements should be met before installing the Sun
ONE Application Server 7, Enterprise Edition product:
• Removing previously-installed Sun ONE Application Server 7 software—If
there is previously-installed Sun ONE Application Server 7 software on the
target machine, you must remove it using the uninstallation program before
starting installation.
• Available ports
? You’ll assign one for the Admin Server and another for the HTTP server
default instance during installation.
? The installation program will detect used ports and assign two others for
you: Sun ONE Message Queue (by default, 7676), and IIOP (by default,
3700). If either of these default port numbers are in use, the installation
program will assign the next available port (for example, 7677 or 7678, and
so on).
? Additional ports will be needed for the HADB servers. Refer to the HADB
configuration chapter in the Sun ONE Application Server Administrator’s
Guide for guidelines.
• Root privileges—You must have root privileges on your target machine.
NOTE Solaris 9 bundled installations or non-package-based evaluation
installations do not affect the Enterprise Edition installation
program, so they do not need to be removed from your system.
However, port conflicts must be resolved.
Installation Requirements
28 Sun ONE Application Server Version 7, Enterprise Edition Installation Guide • September 2003
• Single installation—You can have only one installation per machine, however,
you can have multiple instances running within the same installation.
High-Availability Requirements
The following requirements are key to setting up your high-availability
environment:
• Topology Planning
• Space Considerations
• Web Server Installation
• Shared Memory Setup
• Remote Access Setup
Topology Planning
Before you install the Sun ONE Application Server 7, Enterprise Edition software,
you will need to decide on product topology, that is, which component will be
hosted on which available system. The Sun ONE Application Server and the HADB
server can generally be hosted in two ways:
• Application Server and HADB server node hosted on the same system
• Application Server and HADB server node hosted on separate systems
In both cases, at least two systems per component are needed to achieve high
availability.
The installation program enforces explicit component dependencies, but will not
otherwise limit combinations of product components that can be installed on a
particular machine. As a result, the number of possible product topologies is quite
large.
Details on the various topologies that can be implemented for the Always On
Technology are discussed in the Enterprise Edition of the Sun ONE Application
Server Operational Deployment Guide.
Installation Requirements
Chapter 1 Preparing to Install 29
Space Considerations
Data devices should not be filled beyond 50% of capacity because additional space
is needed to refragment the HADB. If refragmentation fails, it might be because
devices are too full and there is not enough space. If devices are running at 80% or
90% of capacity and refragmentation fails, the HADB will need to be cleared,
meaning that all data removed from the database and the session schema.
It is important to monitor the space on the devices using the hadbm deviceinfo
command. When device capacity exceeds 50%, additional nodes should be added.
Refer to the Sun ONE Application Server Administrator’s Guide and the Sun ONE
Performance Tuning Guide for information and instructions.
Web Server Installation
Before you start the installation process, your web server must be installed on any
machine where you are going to install the load balancer plug-in.
Currently-supported versions include the following:
• Sun ONE Web Server 6.0 SP6
• Apache Web Server 1.3.27
For installing the Sun ONE Web Server, refer to the iPlanet WebServer Installation
Guide at this location:
http://docs.sun.com/db/prod/s1websrv
Instructions for installing the plug-in are contained in “Installing the Load Balancer
Plug-in” on page 44.
Shared Memory Setup
You will need to configure shared memory on the HADB hosts before you can set
up the HADB. This can be done before or after installing the high-availability
components. Refer to “Configuring Shared Memory and Semaphores” on page 53
for instructions.
Remote Access Setup
Before you can set up the HADB, you will need to configure remote access on the
HADB hosts to enable the high-availability management client to communicate
among HADB nodes. This can be done before or after installing the
high-availability components. Refer to “Setting Up Host Communication” on
page 55 for instructions on configuring OpenSSH/SSH or RSH.
Accessing the Documentation
30 Sun ONE Application Server Version 7, Enterprise Edition Installation Guide • September 2003
Accessing the Documentation
The Sun ONE Application Server documentation is provided in a number of ways:
• Manuals—The Sun ONE Application Server 7, Enterprise Edition manuals and
release notes, in HTML and in printable PDF, are available on the
documentation CD-ROM that comes with the product.
• Online help—Click the Help button in the graphical interface to launch a
context-sensitive help window.
• Man pages—To view man pages at the command line, you must first add
install_dir/man to your MANPATH environment variable (Solaris) and add the
HADB /bin directory to PATH. After setting the variable, you can access man
pages for the Sun ONE Application Server commands by typing man
command_name on the command line. For example:
man asadmin

32 Sun ONE Application Server Version 7, Enterprise Edition Installation Guide • September 2003
About Installation
Only one Sun ONE Application Server 7 installation can reside on a single
machine. If an installation of Application Server 7 already exists on your system,
the installation program will not overwrite it, but the pre-existing installation will
be detected and you will not be allowed to proceed with the installation until you
have removed the existing Application Server 7 software using the uninstallation
program.
The following topics are addressed in this section:
• Installation Components
• Installation Options
Installation Components
In general, you are installing the basic components that provide the functionality of
the Sun ONE Application Server Version 7, Enterprise Edition product. You can
choose not to install some of the components. Later, if you want to add a
component that you initially chose not to install, you can do an incremental
installation of that component, providing dependencies are met.
Since only one installation of the same component package on the same system is
allowed, the installation program tries to detect components that are already
installed. If a component is already installed, installation of that component is
disabled.
NOTE Solaris 9 bundled installations and non-package-based evaluation
installations do not affect the Enterprise Edition installation
program, so they do not need to be removed from your system.
NOTE Using either of the interactive methods, you can do a partial
installation which can be followed by any number of incremental
(subsequent) installations. For silent mode, you can do a partial
initial installation, but any subsequent installations must be done
using an interactive method.
About Installation
Chapter 2 Installing Enterprise Edition Software 33
The installation program enforces component dependencies as specified for each
component. Once component dependencies are satisfied, component life cycles are
independent. A particular component can be installed or uninstalled dynamically
through incremental installation and partial uninstallation mechanisms without
corrupting other components.
The following installation components are included with the Sun ONE Application
Server 7, Enterprise Edition product:
• Sun ONE Application Server—all of Sun ONE Appserver 7, including its
graphical and command-line administrative tools, the asadmin command, and
Sun ONE Message Queue 3.0.1
• Sun ONE Application Server Administration Client—only the asadmin
command
• Java 2 Software Development Kit (J2SE), Standard Edition 1.4.0_03
• Sample applications (Optional)
• High-Availability Database (HADB)—all of HADB, including the hadbm
command
• HADB Management Client—only the hadbm command
• Load balancer plug-in for web servers
NOTE If you want to install the Application Server and an HADB server
node on the same system, select both components. Otherwise select
only one of them.
The clsetup command must be run from a machine where the
asadmin and the hadbm utilities are available. Instructions for using
the clsetup command to create a basic cluster can be found in
“Using the clsetup Command” on page 65.
NOTE You can choose to install the administration client command-line
version separately on a machine where the Application Server is not
installed. Do this by selecting only the Administration Client
component during incremental installation.
About Installation
34 Sun ONE Application Server Version 7, Enterprise Edition Installation Guide • September 2003
The load balancer plug-in is usually installed in a separate process on a
separate machine. Refer to “Installing the Load Balancer Plug-in” on page 44
for guidelines.
See “Installation Components” on page 17 for further description of the Sun ONE
Application Server components.
Installation Options
There are three ways you can perform the installation:
• Graphical method (interactive)—The installation program prompts you using
a sequence of graphical screens. This is the default method.
• Command-line method (interactive)—The installation program prompts you
using a sequence of command-line prompts and messages.
• Silent mode—The installation program reads installation parameters from a
supplied configuration file and logs all output into a log file.
The setup command allows you to specify the method you want to use for
installation, and allows you to create a configuration file for silent installation.
Use the following syntax when running the setup command:
setup [-console] [-silent config_file] [-savestate]
Table 2-1 describes the setup command options.
NOTE The default installation mode is the graphical method, so if you
don’t specify an option when you run setup, the installation
program presents the graphical screens.
Table 2-1 Options for the setup Command
Option Description
-console Runs the installation using the command-line method.
About Installation
Chapter 2 Installing Enterprise Edition Software 35
Installation Syntax
• To run the installation using the graphical interface, type the following at the
command prompt (no options; this is the default method):
./setup
• To run the installation using the command-line interface, type:
./setup -console
• To run the installation using the graphical interface and create an installation
configuration file for silent mode installation:
./setup -savestate
The file called statefile will be created in install_dir.
• To run the installation using the command-line interface and create an
installation configuration file for silent mode installation:
./setup -console -savestate
The file called statefile will be created in install_dir.
• To run a silent mode installation based on an existing installation configuration
file:
./setup -silent config_file
Refer to “Installing in Silent Mode (Non-Interactive)” on page 48 for further
specifics on silent mode installation and the installation configuration file.
-silent config_file Runs the installation in silent mode. Installation parameters are read from
an existing installation configuration file. This option is mutually exclusive
with the savestate option.
The installation configuration file path must be explicitly provided; there
is no default file path. Refer to “Installing in Silent Mode
(Non-Interactive)” on page 48 for further specifics on silent mode
installation and the installation configuration file.
-savestate Runs the installation using either the graphical or command-line method
and creates an installation configuration file based on this installation. This
option is mutually exclusive with the silent option. If you do not specify
this option, no installation configuration file will be created.
The file will be called statefile and located in install_dir.

Installing Application Server Software
This section provides instructions for installing the Sun ONE Application Server
software using either the graphical-interface or command-line interface. The steps
are identical for both methods. However, for the command-line interface,
text-based screens are displayed instead of graphical screens.
After you have planned the topology, run the installation program on each system,
selecting and installing the appropriate components based on your topology.
1. Uninstall any previous versions of the Sun ONE Application Server 7 software
on the machines where you are going to install the Enterprise Edition of the
Application Server.
2. Verify that all requirements that apply to your installation have been met. See
“Installation Requirements” on page 23 for information on requirements.
3. Log in as root and create a temporary directory for the product distribution
file.
TIP If you are familiar with high availability concepts and installation of
enterprise-level products, you may want to use the summary
checklists in Appendix A, “Installation Cheatsheet.”
NOTE If the previously-installed packages are bundled in the Solaris
operating environment, they need not be removed. However, port
conflicts must be resolved.
Installing Application Server Software
Chapter 2 Installing Enterprise Edition Software 37
4. Start all the processes on your system that use ports and are expected to run at
the same time as the Application Server software. This allows the installation
program to detect what ports are in use and avoid assigning them for other
purposes.
5. For a download, unzip the .gz file as follows:
gunzip sun-appserver7-sol.tar.gz
6. For a download, untar the unzipped file as follows:
tar -xvf sun-appserver7-sol.tar
This process may take a little time. When the files are unpacked, you will see
the sun-appserver7 directory, which contains the setup file and the pkg
directory.
7. Navigate to the sun-appserver7 directory.
8. Select your installation method.
Refer to “Installation Options” on page 34 for guidelines on selecting the
correct options to use with the setup command.
When the installation starts, the Welcome page of the installation program is
displayed.
9. Read the Welcome page and click Next.
The License Agreement page is displayed.
10. Read the License Agreement and click Yes to agree to the terms of the license
(or type Yes at the command line), then click Next.
NOTE If you are installing the load balancer plug-in, your web server
must already be installed on the machines where you are going
to install the load balancer plug-in before you start the
installation process. Refer to “High-Availability Requirements”
on page 28.

13. Sun ONE Message Queue—If the installation program detects a version of the
Sun ONE Message Queue preinstalled in your system, you are presented with
one of the following actions:
? If the correct version of the package-based Sun ONE Message Queue is
installed, it will be reused. You can choose to exit at this point. If you don’t
exit, the installation program will use the installed version and proceed to
the next step.
NOTE If some components are disabled on the Component Selection
page (or if a command-line mode installation did not offer them
for installation), this means the disabled component has been
detected as already installed on your system.
NOTE If you want to install Sun ONE Application Server and an
HADB server node on the same system, select them both.
Otherwise, select only one of them.
NOTE If you do not already have your web server installed on the machine
where you are installing the load balancer plug-in, you cannot
continue to install the load-balancer plug-in.

in this step, refer to “J2SE Installation/Upgrade Issues” on page 94):
? If the correct version of the package-based J2SE is installed, it will be
reused or you can enter the path to another correct version. The installation
program proceeds to the next step.
? If there is no package-based J2SE installed, you can choose to let the
installation program install the J2SE package automatically or reuse an
existing J2SE installation.
? If an incorrect version of the package-based J2SE is found, a message is
displayed asking if you want to upgrade your current version or cancel.
Choose one of the following options:
• To have the installation program update your current J2SE version,
click Upgrade (or type 1 at the command line).
• To exit the installation program, click Cancel (or type 2 at the
command line).
Before continuing with the installation, you must uninstall the J2SE
currently located in /usr/j2se or upgrade it to J2SE 1.4.1_03. Then
restart the Application Server installation.
NOTE Because other applications might be running and using this J2SE
installation, upgrading J2SE is a potentially disruptive process. You

Installing in Silent Mode (Non-Interactive)
48 Sun ONE Application Server Version 7, Enterprise Edition Installation Guide • September 2003
Installing in Silent Mode (Non-Interactive)
If you choose to install the Sun ONE Application Server Version 7, Enterprise
Edition software in silent mode, the installation program runs without any user
input. This is made possible when the installation program accesses a text file that
provides the installation program with the configuration information it needs.
The following topics are discussed in this section:
• Creating the Installation Configuration File
• Installing in Silent Mode
Creating the Installation Configuration File
The installation configuration file is created when you use the savestate option
with the setup command to start a interactive installation. During the interactive
installation, your input is collected and stored in the configuration file you
specified. This forms the template for silent installation, which you can use later to
install the product on one or more machines.
If needed, you can modify the installation configuration file.
The following topics are addressed in this section:
• Syntax for Creating the Installation Configuration File
• Example Installation Configuration File
• Modifying the Installation Configuration File
Syntax for Creating the Installation Configuration File
The syntax for creating an installation configuration file is as follows:
For graphical method:
./setup -savestate
For command-line method:
./setup -console -savestate
Refer to “Installation Options” on page 34 for more detailed information.
Example Installation Configuration File
An installation configuration file looks similar to the following:

5. If you are not in the directory already, navigate to the directory where you
copied the installation files and your installation configuration file.
6. As superuser, start silent installation at the command line using the following
command format:
./setup -silent config_file
The installation program reads the specified config_file, checks for adequate disk
space, then installs the product based on the data in config_file.
When the prompt is returned, the silent installation is complete and the
installation components are now installed on your systems.
7. You can start the Application Server software by using the instructions on
“Starting and Stopping the Server” on page 81.
When the Admin Console has been started, the initial page of the Application
Server graphical interface is displayed.
You are now ready to configure your system for high availability. Proceed to
“Preparing for HADB Setup” on page 53 to begin this process.
53
Chapter 3
Preparing for HADB Setup
After the high-availability components have been installed on the servers that will
be part of an cluster, perform the tasks in this chapter to prepare for setting up high
availability. Refer to “Installation Roadmap” on page 16 to see the full sequence of
events for implementing the Sun ONE Application Server 7, Enterprise Edition
product.
The following topics are addressed here:
• Configuring Shared Memory and Semaphores
• Setting Up Host Communication
• Setting Up the User Environment
• Setting Up Administration for Non-Root
• Using the clsetup Command
After you have done the tasks here, proceed to the Sun ONE Application Server
Administrator’s Guide for comprehensive instructions on configuring and
managing the cluster, the load balancer plug-in, and the high-availability database
(HADB).
Information on high-availability topologies is available in the Sun ONE Application
Server System Deployment Guide.
Configuring Shared Memory and Semaphores
You will need to configure shared memory for the HADB host machines before
beginning to work with the HADB.
1. Log in as root.
Configuring Shared Memory and Semaphores
54 Sun ONE Application Server Version 7, Enterprise Edition Installation Guide • September 2003
2. Add lines similar to the following to the /etc/system file if they do not
already exist:
For shared memory:
set shmsys:shminfo_shmmax=0x80000000
set shmsys:shminfo_shmseg=20
This example sets maximum shared memory shmmax to 2GB (hexadecimal
0x80000000) which is sufficient for most configurations.
The shmsys:shminfo_shmmax setting is calculated as 10,000,0000 per 256 MB
and should set to be identical to the memory size for the host. To determine
your host’s memory, run this command:
prtconf | grep Memory
Then plug the value into the following formula:
((<host> MB / 256 MB) * 10,000,000)
For semaphores:
Your /etc/system file may already contain semmni, semmns, and semmnu
entries. For example:
set semsys:seminfo_semmni=10
set semsys:seminfo_semmns=60
set semsys:seminfo_semmnu=30
NOTE If necessary, make sure permissions are set correctly to
administer the HADB as non-root user. See “Setting up RSH for
HADB Administration” on page 56, Step 5.
Setting Up Host Communication
Chapter 3 Preparing for HADB Setup 55
If the entries are present, increment the values by adding 16, 128, and 1000
respectively, as follows:
set semsys:seminfo_semmni=26
set semsys:seminfo_semmns=188
set semsys:seminfo_semmnu=1030
If your /etc/system file does not contain the above mentioned entries, add the
following entries at the end of the file:
set semsys:seminfo_semmni=16
set semsys:seminfo_semmns=128
set semsys:seminfo_semmnu=1000
This is sufficient to run up to 16 HADB nodes on the computer.
3. Reboot the machine for changes to take effect.
For an explanation of HADB nodes, see Configuring the High Availability
Database in the Sun ONE Application Server Administrator’s Guide.
Setting Up Host Communication
To implement remote access for HADB administration, all machines that will be
used for running HADB servers and the HADB management client must be
configured for Remote Shell (RSH) or Secured Shell (OpenSSH/SSH).
RSH is a simple remote shell command and does not have any security features.
The SSH communication channel provides a level of security by encrypting the
data that passes between the HADB nodes.
NOTE Your original /etc/system file may or may not contain all of these
entries.
Setting Up Host Communication
56 Sun ONE Application Server Version 7, Enterprise Edition Installation Guide • September 2003
This section contains instructions for the following tasks:
• Setting up RSH for HADB Administration
• Setting Up SSH for HADB Administration
Setting up RSH for HADB Administration
If you want to use RSH instead of SSH, you must explicitly specify RSH using the
set managementProtocol option. Refer to Table 3-3 on page 72 for guidelines on
setting this parameter in the clresource.conf file.
To implement RSH, perform these steps:
1. Log in as root.
2. Edit the /etc/hosts file to contain entries for all the selected HADB hosts,
including the host name of the local host. Use localhost format. For example:
computer1.xbay.company.com
computer99.zmtn.company.com
3. Append this file to the /etc/hosts file of all selected installation hosts.
NOTE For Solaris 9, it is recommended that you use the default installation
of SSH. However, you can use RSH if preferred by following the
instructions in “Setting up RSH for HADB Administration” on
page 56 and then editing the clresource.conf file to specific RSH as
described in “Running the clsetup Command” on page 77.
On Solaris 8, by default SSH is not installed. Follow the instructions
in “Installing SSH for Solaris 8” on page 59 if SSH is not on your
Solaris 8 system.
If you want to use SSH, but it is not configured or not available, you
will not be able to use the hadbm command. Refer to “SSH
Requirements and Limitations” on page 58 to verify that SSH is
recognized.
NOTE SSH is the strongly recommended default for the hadbm create
command because SSH is more secure than RSH.
Setting Up Host Communication
Chapter 3 Preparing for HADB Setup 57
4. Create a .rhosts file in the $HOME directory of the HADB user, if one does
not already exist.
vi .rhosts
5. Verify that permissions are set to Read Only for group and other. For example:
rw-r--r--
6. Add the host name of each HADB host, including the name of your local host,
followed by the name of your database user. For example, if the database user
is Jon:
computer1.xbay.company.com Jon
computer99.zmtn.company.com Jon
mine456.red.mycompany.com Jon
7. Append this file to the .rhosts file of each HADB host.
8. Check host communication for each host. For example:
rsh computer99.zmtn.company.com uname -a
If all is well, the identity will be returned from the other host.
Setting Up SSH for HADB Administration
SSH is strongly recommended for using the hadbm create command because SSH
is more secure than RSH.
This section contains the following sections:
• SSH Requirements and Limitations
• Installing SSH for Solaris 8
• Configuring SSH
NOTE From a security perspective, the DSA-based version 2 protocol is
recommended instead of the RSA-based version 1 protocol. The
version you select depends on the SSH client software in use at your
site.
Setting Up Host Communication
58 Sun ONE Application Server Version 7, Enterprise Edition Installation Guide • September 2003
SSH Requirements and Limitations
You may need to take action on any or all of the following requirements during
your SSH setup:
• Location of the SSH binaries—The high-availability management client expects
to find the ssh and scp binaries in the following location on each HADB host:
/usr/bin
? If the binaries are on your system but this location is not correct, you will
need to make a symbolic link from /usr/bin to the correct location.
? If you are on a Solaris 8 system, the SSH binaries are not installed by
default and so may not be present. If this is the case, follow the instructions
in “Installing SSH for Solaris 8” on page 59.
• Support—The only tested support is for SunSSH and OpenSSH. If you are
using another version of SSH, it is best to refer to the setup instructions in that
product’s documentation to ensure that your SSH communications work
correctly.
• OpenSSH clients and daemons—If you are running in an environment with
OpenSSH clients and daemons, you should name the key file as follows:
~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 or ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.
• Running as root—If you are running the HADB admin clients as root, make
sure that the sshd configuration (/etc/ssh/sshd_config) on all machines has
the PermitRootLogin parameter set to yes.
NOTE Although SSH is installed by default on Solaris 9 systems, on Solaris
8, by default SSH is not installed. Instructions for installing SSH for
Solaris 8 are contained in “Installing SSH for Solaris 8” on page 59.
NOTE By default, Sun SSH does not permit root login; it is set to no. If the
sshd configuration is changed, sshd must be restarted. Type the
following to restart the service:
/etc/init.d/sshd stop/start
Setting Up Host Communication
Chapter 3 Preparing for HADB Setup 59
• No SSH protocol version 2 support—If your SSH clients and daemons do not
support SSH protocol version 2, you will need to run ssh-keygen without
options. The key file will then be named identity.pub instead of id_dsa.pub.
This file must be appended to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.
• Mixed SSH environment—If you are operating in a mixed SSH environment,
you will need to create both files ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 and
~/.ssh/authorized_keys; the latter may contain both version 1 and version 2
keys.
• Co-location—If the Sun ONE Application Server and the HADB are co-located
on the same machine, you will need to create a known_hosts file under the
.ssh directory by running one of the following commands:
ssh localhost
or
ssh hostname
Installing SSH for Solaris 8
The ssh and scp binaries are not installed by default on Solaris 8 systems. If the
binaries are not on your Solaris 8 system, perform these steps:
1. Go to the following site:
http://www.sunfreeware.com/openssh8.html
On this site, you may receive a message similar to the following:
===PLEASE NOTE!!!............ make a note of some of the mirror
sites so that if the servers are down, you can still download
from a mirror site.
If you receive such a message, try one of the many mirror sites listed in the
FTP/Mirror Sites link. For example:
http://sunfreeware.secsup.org/
2. On this site, follow the instructions in the Installation Steps to download and
install all the necessary OpenSSH packages and patches.
3. After you have installed OpenSSH, proceed to the next section on Configuring
SSH.
Configuring SSH
To set up SSH on a system where the ssh and scp binaries are already installed,
perform the steps in one of the following sections:
Setting Up Host Communication
60 Sun ONE Application Server Version 7, Enterprise Edition Installation Guide • September 2003
• SSH for Non-Mounted Home Directories
• SSH for Mounted Home Directories
SSH for Non-Mounted Home Directories
To implement SSH in systems with home directories that are not mounted,
perform these steps:
1. Verify that SSH requirements have been understood and met as specified in
“SSH Requirements and Limitations” on page 58.
2. Log in to the host as the HADB user.
3. Generate your keys by running the following:
ssh-keygen -t dsa
For SSH1 and OpenSSH/1, you normally do not need to give any parameters
to the ssh-keygen command.
4. For the next three prompts, accept the default options by pressing Enter.
5. Repeat steps 1, 2, and 3 for all machines in your cluster.
A file called identity.pub or id_dsa.pub (depends on whether you are using
SSH version 1 or version 2) located in your ~/.ssh directory holds the public key.
To connect to a machine without being asked for a password, the content of this file
must be appended to a file called authorized_keys on all the machines.
6. To set up login identity, go to your user directory:
~/.ssh.
For SSH1, OpenSSH/1:
a. Copy the identity.pub file and name it authorized_keys.
b. For each of the other machines in the cluster, copy the content of the
identity.pub file and append it to the local authorized_keys file.
OpenSSH/2:
a. Copy the id_dsa.pub file and name it authorized_keys2.
b. For each of the other machines in the cluster, copy the content of the
id_dsa.pub file and append it to the local authorized_keys2 file.
7. Copy the authorized_keys file to the ~/.ssh directory on all the HADB
machines.
Setting Up Host Communication
Chapter 3 Preparing for HADB Setup 61
8. Verify that the .ssh directory, HADB user’s home directory, and the
.ssh/authorized_keys file do not have write permissions for group and
other.
If needed, disable these group/other write permissions as follows:
chmod og-w ~/.ssh
chmod og-w ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod og-w $HOME
Replace $HOME with the home directory of the HADB user. For example:
chmod og-w ~/johnsmith
9. To enable login without any user input, at initial SSH usage (after the SSH
environment is set up) you need to add the node machine name to the
known_hosts file under the /.ssh directory as follows:
a. Type the following:
ssh machine_name
You will be prompted with a Yes/No question whether to add
machine_name to the known_hosts file.
b. Answer Yes.
You will now be able to log in without any input.
10. To verify that SSH is set up correctly, SSH to each host in the cluster before
trying to run the management tool for HADB.
You are automatically logged in without a password requirement.
SSH for Mounted Home Directories
To implement SSH in systems with mounted home directories, perform these
steps:
1. Verify that SSH requirements have been understood and met as specified in
“SSH Requirements and Limitations” on page 58
NOTE If the files under the ~/.ssh directory have even read permission
given to group/other, you cannot set up an automatic SSH login
identity. In this case, if you try ssh machine_name, the system
complains about the incorrect permissions and asks for a password.
In other words, it is best not to give any permissions at all for
group/other if you want to enable automatic login.
Setting Up Host Communication
62 Sun ONE Application Server Version 7, Enterprise Edition Installation Guide • September 2003
2. Log in to host as the HADB user.
3. Generate your keys by running the following:
ssh-keygen -t dsa
For SSH1 and OpenSSH/1, you normally do not need to give any parameters
to the ssh-keygen command.
4. For the next three prompts, accept the default options by pressing Enter.
A file called identity.pub or id_dsa.pub (depends on whether you are using
SSH version 1 or version 2) located in your ~/.ssh directory holds the public
key. To connect to a machine without being asked for a password, the content
of this file must be appended to a file called authorized_keys2 on all the
machines. This can be done as follows:
5. To set up login identity, go to your user directory:
~/.ssh.
For SSH1, OpenSSH/1—Copy the identity.pub file and name it
authorized_keys.
For OpenSSH/2—Copy the id_dsa.pub file and name it authorized_keys.
6. Verify that the .ssh directory and the .ssh/authorized_keys file do not have
write permissions for group and other.
If necessary, disable these group/other write permissions as follows:
chmod og-w ~/.ssh
chmod og-w ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod og-w /$HOME
Replace HOME with the home directory of the HADB user. For example:
chmod og-w ~/johnsmith.
NOTE If the files under the ~/.ssh directory have even read permission
given to group/other, you cannot set up an automatic SSH login
identity. In this case, if you try to run ssh machine_name, the system
complains about =incorrect permissions and asks for a password. In
other words, it is best not to give any permissions for group/other if
you want to enable automatic login.
Setting Up the User Environment
Chapter 3 Preparing for HADB Setup 63
7. To enable login without any user input, at initial SSH usage (after the SSH
environment is set up) you need to add the node machine name to the
known_hosts file under the /.ssh directory
a. Type the following:
ssh machine_name
You will be queried about whether or not to add machine_name to the
known_hosts file.
b. Answer Yes.
You will now be able to log in without any input.
8. To verify that SSH is set up correctly, SSH to each host in the cluster before
trying to run the management tool for HADB.
You are automatically logged in without a password requirement.
Setting Up the User Environment
After you have set up host communication, you can run the hadbm command from
the install_dir/SUNWhadb/4/bin directory location as follows:
./hadbm
However, it is much more convenient to set up your local environment to use the
high-availability management client commands from anywhere. To set this up,
perform the following steps.
1. Set the PATH variable as follows.
setenv PATH ${PATH}:install_dir/bin:install_dir/SUNWhadb/4/bin
2. Verify that the PATH settings are correct by running the following commands:
which asadmin
which hadbm
NOTE The examples in this section apply to using csh. If you are using
another shell, refer to the man page for your shell for instructions on
setting variables.
Setting Up Administration for Non-Root
64 Sun ONE Application Server Version 7, Enterprise Edition Installation Guide • September 2003
3. If multiple Java versions are installed on your system, you must ensure that the
JAVA_HOME environment variable points to the correct Java version (1.4.1_03
for Enterprise Edition).
setenv JAVA_HOME java_install_dir
setenv PATH ${PATH}:${JAVA_HOME}/bin
Setting Up Administration for Non-Root
By default, during the initial installation or setup of the Sun ONE Application
Server, write permissions of the files and paths created for Sun ONE Application
Server are given to root only. For a user other than root to create or manage the Sun
ONE Application Server, write permissions on the associated files must be given to
that specific user, or to a group to which the user belongs. The files that are affected
are the following (with their default locations):
• Sun ONE Application Server configuration files—install_config_dir/cl*.conf
• Sun ONE Application Servers setup and administration scripts—
install_dir/bin/cl*
• HADB binaries—install_dir/SUNWhadb
• HADB configuration—/etc/opt/SUNWhadb
You can create a user group for managing the Sun ONE Application Server as
described in the following procedure. (An alternate approach is to set permissions
and ownership for the specific user.)
To create a Sun ONE Application Server user group and set permissions on the
installation root directory, repeat the following process for each affected file:
1. Log in as root.
2. From the command prompt, create the Sun ONE Application Server user
group. For example:
# groupadd s1asuser
You can type groupadd at the command line to see appropriate usage.
3. Change the group ownership for each affected file to the newly-created group.
For example:
chgrp -R s1asuser install_config_dir/cl*.conf
Using the clsetup Command
Chapter 3 Preparing for HADB Setup 65
4. Set the write permission for the newly-created group:
chmod -R g+rw install_config_dir/cl*.conf
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each affected file.
6. Make the clsetup and cladmin commands executable by the newly-created
group. For example:
chmod -R g+x install_dir/bin/cl*
7. Delete and recreate the default domain, domain1, using the --sysuser option.
The sysuser must also belong to the newly-created group. For example:
asadmin delete-domain domain1
asadmin create-domain --sysuser bleonard --adminport 4848
--adminuser admin --adminpassword password domain1
Using the clsetup Command
The purpose of the clsetup command is to automate the process of setting up a
basic cluster in a typical configuration. The clsetup command is located in
install_dir/bin, where install_dir is the directory where the Sun ONE Application
Server software is installed.
The clsetup command is bundled with the Sun ONE Application Server software
along with the cladmin command.
The following topics are addressed in this section:
• How the clsetup Command Works
• clsetup Requirements and Limitations
• Editing the clsetup Input Files
NOTE The cladmin command is used to streamline the process of
configuring and administering the cluster after all installation and
configuration tasks are complete, and is not documented here.
When you have completed the tasks in this Installation Guide, refer
to the Sun ONE Application Server Administrator’s Guide for
instructions on creating the HADB and on using on the cladmin
command.
Using the clsetup Command
66 Sun ONE Application Server Version 7, Enterprise Edition Installation Guide • September 2003
• Running the clsetup Command
• Cleanup Procedures for the clsetup Command
How the clsetup Command Works
The clsetup command is a set of Sun ONE Application Server commands that are
gathered together in a script that allows a cluster to be configured automatically,
based on prepopulated input files. As part of cluster setup, an HADB is created,
but you will still need to set up your working cluster using the hadbm commands
as described in the Sun ONE Application Server Administrator’s Guide.
The following topics are addressed in this section:
• How the Input Files Work
• What the clsetup Command Accomplishes
• Commands Used by the clsetup Command
How the Input Files Work
Three input files are used by the clsetup command to configure the cluster:
• clinstance.conf—This file is pre-populated with information about
application server instances server1 and server2. Refer to “The clinstance.conf
File” on page 70 for information on the contents of this file.
• clpassword.conf—This file is pre-populated with the Admin Server
password for domain1, which you provided when you installed the Sun ONE
Application Server 7, Enterprise Edition software. Refer to “The
clpassword.conf File” on page 71 for information on the contents of this file.
• clresource.conf—This file is pre-populated with information about the
cluster resources: HADB, JDBC connection pool, JDBC resource, and session
store and persistence. Refer to “The clresource.conf File” on page 72 for
information on the contents of this file.
NOTE The clsetup command interface is unstable. An unstable interface
may be experimental or transitional, and may therefore change
incompatibly, be removed, or be replaced by a more stable interface
in the next release.
Using the clsetup Command
Chapter 3 Preparing for HADB Setup 67
You can use the clsetup configuration parameters as they are preconfigured to set
up a typical cluster configuration. To support a different configuration, you can
make edits to any or all of the configuration files.
What the clsetup Command Accomplishes
Using the pre-populated values in the clsetup input files, the clsetup command
accomplishes the following:
• Creates a new server instance named server2 in the default domain named
domain1. The HTTP port number for server2 is the next sequential number
after the HTTP port number specified for server1 during installation (for
example, if port number 80 is provided for server1 during installation, the port
number for server2 is 81).
• Creates the HADB named hadb with two nodes on the local machine. The port
base is 15200, and the database password is password.
• Creates the HADB tables required to store session information in the HADB.
• Creates a connection pool named appservCPL in all the instances listed in the
clinstance.conf file (server1, server2).
• Creates a JDBC resource named jdbc/hastore in all the instances listed in the
clinstance.conf file (server1, server2).
• Configures the session persistence information in all the instances listed in the
clinstance.conf file (server1, server2).
• Enables high availability in all the instances listed in the clinstance.conf file
(server1, server2).
NOTE The configuration parameters required to set up the cluster are
always read from the input files, and cannot be supplied through
the command line.
NOTE Because the clresource.conf and clpassword.conf input files
store passwords, they are access-protected with 0600 permissions.
Using the clsetup Command
68 Sun ONE Application Server Version 7, Enterprise Edition Installation Guide • September 2003
Commands Used by the clsetup Command
The clsetup command uses a number of hadbm and asadmin commands to
perform the steps for setting up the cluster. In Table 3-1, the clsetup task is
described in the left column and the command used to accomplish the task is listed
in the right column.
clsetup Requirements and Limitations
The following requirements and limitations apply to the clsetup command:
• The install paths, device paths, configuration paths, and so on must be the
same on all machines that are of the cluster.
• Before you can use the clsetup command, the asadmin and hadbm commands
must be available on the local machine. Therefore, this command can only be
run on a machine where the following are installed:
? The Sun ONE Application Server component or the Sun ONE Application
Server Administration Client component
? The HADB component or the HADB Management Client component
• Before you can use the clsetup command, you must have configured shared
memory as described in “Configuring Shared Memory and Semaphores” on
page 53. The clsetup command does not set any shared memory values.
Table 3-1 hadbm and asadmin Commands Used by the clsetup Command
Task Performed by clsetup Command

Using the clsetup Command
Chapter 3 Preparing for HADB Setup 69
• Before you can use the clsetup command, you must have set up the HADB
cluster host communication for SSH or RSH as described in “Setting Up Host
Communication” on page 55.
• If you are using RSH (which is not the default), you will need to uncomment
the following line in the clresource.conf file (remove the # sign):
#set managementProtocol
• If you are co-locating the Application Server and the HADB on the same
machine using SSH, a known_hosts file must exist under the .ssh directory. If
it does not, run either the ssh localhostor the ssh hostname command before using
the clsetup command.
• Before running the clsetup command, you must start the Admin Servers of all
the Sun ONE Application Server instances that are part of the cluster.
• The administrator password must be the same for all domains that are part of
the cluster.
• If the entities to be handled (HADB nodes and Application Server instances)
already exist, the clsetup command does not delete or reconfigure them, and
the respective configuration steps are skipped.
• The values specified in the input files will be the same for all the instances in a
cluster. The clsetup command is not designed to set up instances with
different values. For example, this command cannot create a JDBC connection
pool with different settings for each instance.
• The clsetup command does not perform any inetd configuration; the HADB
is created with no inetd settings. Instructions for performing inetd
configuration are contained in the Sun ONE Application Server Administrator’s
Guide.
• Host names in the shell initialization files—If prompts are included with host
names in your .cshrc or .login files, the clsetup command may appear to
hang. You will need to remove any prompts and excess output in any remote
command invocations. For example, running the hostname command on hostB
should print hostB without a prompt.
• To run the clsetup command as a user other than root, you'll need to make the
changes as described in “Setting Up Administration for Non-Root” on page 64.
Using the clsetup Command
70 Sun ONE Application Server Version 7, Enterprise Edition Installation Guide • September 2003
Editing the clsetup Input Files
The input files that are needed for the clsetup command are installed under the
configuration installation directory, default /etc/opt/SUNWappserver7, as part of
the installation procedure. The installation program pre-populates these files with
the values to set up a typical configuration, but you can edit any or all of them as
needed using a text editor.
This section addresses the following topics:
• The clinstance.conf File
• The clpassword.conf File
• The clresource.conf File
The clinstance.conf File
For the clsetup command to work properly, all application server instances that
are part of a cluster must be defined in the clinstance.conf file. During
installation, the installation program creates a clinstance.conf file with entries
for two instances. If you add more instances to the cluster, you must add
information about these additional instances.
The format of the clinstance.conf file is as follows:
# Comment
instancename instance_name
user user_name
host localhost
port admin_port_number
domain domain_n
instanceport instance_port_number
One set of entries is required for each instance that is part of the cluster. Any line
that starts with a hash mark (#) is treated as a comment.
NOTE The order in which these entries appear in the clinstance.conf file
is important and must not be changed from the order specified here.
If you add information about more application server instances,
entries for these instances must appear in this order.
Comments can be added anywhere in the file.
Using the clsetup Command
Chapter 3 Preparing for HADB Setup 71
Table 3-2 provides information about the entries in the clinstance.conf file. The
left column contains the parameter name, the middle column defines the
parameter, and the right column contains the default value specified by the
installation program.
Example clinstance.conf File
This clinstance.conf file contains information about two instances.
#Instance 1
instancename server1
user admin
host localhost
port 4848
domain domain1
instanceport 80
#Instance 2
instancename server2
user admin
host localhost
port 4848
domain domain1
instanceport 81
The clpassword.conf File
When the clsetup command is run, the asadmin command needs the Admin
Server password, which is specified in the clpassword.conf file during
installation.
The format of the clpassword.conf file is as follows:
Table 3-2 Entries in the clinstance.conf File
Parameter Definition Default Value
instancename Application Server instance name server1, server2
user Admin Server user name admin
host Host name localhost
port Admin Server port number 4848

AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD= password
where password is the Admin Server password.
Permissions 0600 are preset on the clpassword.conf file, which can only be
accessed by the root user.
The clresource.conf File
During installation, the installation program creates the clresource.conf file to
set up a typical configuration. The clresource.conf file contains information
about the following resources that are part of the cluster:
• HADB information
• Session store information
• JDBC connection pool information
• JDBC resource information
• Session persistence information
Permissions 0600 are preset on the clresource.conf file, which can only be
accessed by the root user.
The parameters of the clresource.conf file are described in the following tables.
The left column contains the parameter name, the middle column defines the
parameter, and the right column contains the default value specified by the
installation program.
Table 3-3 describes the HADB parameters in the clresource.conf file.
NOTE Before running the clsetup command, the values specified in the
clresource.conf file can be modified for optimization, or for
setting up a different configuration. If you edit the values, make sure
that the order and format of the file is not changed.
Any line that begins with a hash mark (#) is treated as a comment.

Running the clsetup Command
The syntax for running the clsetup command is as follows:
clsetup [--help] [--instancefile instance_file_location] [--resourcefile
resource_file_location] [--passwordfile password_file_location]
If no arguments are specified, the clsetup command assumes the following
defaults:
--instancefile is install_config_dir/clinstance.conf
--resourcefile is install_config_dir/clresource.conf
--passwordfile is install_config_dir/clpassword.conf
You can override these arguments by providing custom input file locations. For
example:
./clsetup --resourcefile /tmp/myappservresource.conf
To run the clsetup command, perform the following steps:
1. Verify that the requirements have been met as described in “clsetup
Requirements and Limitations” on page 68.
NOTE When providing custom input files, follow the required format
found in the input files. For information on doing this, see “Editing
the clsetup Input Files” on page 70.
NOTE If you want to run the clsetup command as a user other than root,
follow the instructions in “Setting Up Administration for Non-Root”
on page 64 to set this up.
Using the clsetup Command
78 Sun ONE Application Server Version 7, Enterprise Edition Installation Guide • September 2003
2. Verify that the input files have the information that is required to set up the
cluster. If necessary, edit the input files following the guidelines in “Editing the
clsetup Input Files” on page 70.
3. If you are using RSH, edit the clresource.conf file to uncomment the
following line (remove the # sign):
#set managementProtocol
4. Go to the Sun ONE Application Server installation /bin directory:
cd install_dir/bin
5. Invoke the clsetup command using the appropriate syntax. For example, to
run the command using the defaults:
./clsetup
The clsetup command displays the welcome message, the prerequisites for
configuring the cluster, and the following message:
Do you want to start configuring your cluster? [Yes/No]
6. To start configuring, type Yes and press Enter.
The clsetup command runs in verbose mode. The various commands are
displayed on the screen as they run, and the output is redirected to the log file,
/var/tmp/clsetup.log.
If a vital error occurs (for example, failure to create a non-existing HADB), the
configuration stops and the error is recorded in the log file. If the log file
already exists, the output is appended to the existing log file.
7. When the clsetup command completes the configuration, you are advised
about the location of the log file. It’s a good idea to scan the log file after each
run.
8. Upon completion, the clsetup command returns the exit codes as described in
Table 3-8:
NOTE If the entities to be handled (HADB nodes and Application
Server instances) already exist, the clsetup command does not
delete or reconfigure them, and the respective configuration
steps are skipped. This type of event is recorded in the log file.
Using the clsetup Command
Chapter 3 Preparing for HADB Setup 79
You can obtain a list of the exit codes by running the following command from the
command line immediately after running the clsetup command:
‘echo $?’
Cleanup Procedures for the clsetup Command
After running the clsetup command, errors that have occurred are logged in the
log file /var/tmp/clsetup.log. Examine the log file after every run of the
clsetup command and correct any significant errors that are reported (for
example, failure to create a non-existing instance).
You can undo all or part of the configuration as follows:
• To delete an Application Server instance, use the following command:
asadmin delete-instance instance_name

Post-installation Tasks
This chapter discusses some tasks you may need to perform during or after
installing the Sun ONE Application Server 7, Enterprise Edition software.
The following topics are addressed here:
• Starting and Stopping the Server
• Creating Domains and Instances
• Web Services Client Implementation
• Stopping and Starting the HADB
Starting and Stopping the Server
Because the Sun ONE Application Server is not automatically started during
installation, you will need to start the application server environment yourself
using either of the following methods:
• Using the Command-line Interface
• Using the Administration Interface
Using the Command-line Interface
You can use the asadmin command-line interface to start and stop:
• The entire application server
• A specific administrative domain
• An individual application server instance
Starting and Stopping the Server
82 Sun ONE Application Server Version 7, Enterprise Edition Installation Guide • September 2003
The subcommands of asadmin listed in Table 4-1 are relevant to start and stop
operations.
Using start-domain and stop-domain
If the Application Server is running, use the following command to stop both the
Admin Server as well as the application server instance of the initially-configured
domain:
asadmin stop-domain --domain domain1 --local
where domain1 is the default name of the administrative domain defined during
installation of the Application Server.
As the command completes, you should observe the following results:
asadmin stop-domain --domain domain1 --local
Instance domain1:server1 stopped
Domain domain1 Stopped.
Likewise, you can start the initially-configured administrative domain by running
the following command:
asadmin start-domain --domain domain1
As the command completes, you should observe the following results:
Table 4-1 Start/Stop Subcommands of asadmin
Subcommand Description
start-appserv Starts the entire Application Server.
stop-appserv Stops the Application Server.
start-domain Starts the administrative server and application server
instances of the specified administrative domain
stop-domain Stops the administrative server and the application server
instances of the specified administrative domain.
start-instance Starts the specified application server instance. Can be run in
either a local or remote mode. In local mode, running this
subcommand does not require the administrative server to be
running.
stop-instance Stops the specified application server instance. Similar in
operation to start-instance.
Starting and Stopping the Server
Chapter 4 Post-installation Tasks 83
asadmin start-domain --domain domain1
Instance domain1:admin-server started
Instance domain1:server1 started
Domain domain1 Started.
Using start-instance and stop-instance
To stop a specific application server instance without relying on the presence of an
Admin Server, you can use the following command:
asadmin stop-instance --local server1
where server1 is the default name of the application server instance. If your
environment contains more than one administrative domain, then you need to
specify the administrative domain name when invoking the stop-instance
command. For example:
asadmin stop-instance --local --domain domain1 server1
To start a specific application server instance in local mode, you can use the
following command:
asadmin start-instance --local server1
If you want to start or stop an instance on a remote system, you can specify the
target Admin Server and administrative user name and password on the
start-instance and stop-instance commands.
Getting Helpful Information
If you run either of these subcommands without parameters, usage information is
displayed. For example:
asadmin start-instance
Invalid number of operands received
Command 'start-instance' not executed successfully
USAGE: start-instance [--user admin_user] [--password
admin_password] [--host localhost] [--port 4848] [--local=false]
[--domain domain_name] [--debug=false] [--secure | -s]
instancename
Alternatively, you can issue the subcommands followed by the --help option to
obtain complete usage information.
Creating Domains and Instances
84 Sun ONE Application Server Version 7, Enterprise Edition Installation Guide • September 2003
Using the Administration Interface
When the Admin Server is running, you can use the web-based Administration
interface to start and stop application server instances.
To start the Administration interface (also called the Admin Console or the
graphical interface):
1. Open a browser window and specify the location of your Admin Server’s
console application.
During installation, the default port number for the Admin Server is set to
4848. If this port was already in use, or you selected another port number,
specify that port number. For example:
http://localhost:4848
2. Sign into the Administration interface using the administrative user name and
password specified during installation.
After you've been successfully authenticated, the initial screen of the
Administration interface is displayed.
3. Select the server1 node to access the start and stop functions.
The application server instance is either in a Running or Not Running state.
4. Depending on the server instance state, click either Start or Stop to start or stop
the application server instance.
Creating Domains and Instances
The installation program creates an initial domain called domain1 with a single
instance called server1. Create any additional domains and server instances using
following commands:
To create a new domain:
asadmin create-domain --adminport port_number --adminuser admin
--adminpassword password domain_name [--path domain_path][--sysuser
sys_user] [--passwordfile file_name]
To create a new instance:
Web Services Client Implementation
Chapter 4 Post-installation Tasks 85
asadmin create-instance --instanceport instanceportinstance_name
[--user admin_user] [-password admin_password] [--host localhost]
[--port 4848] [--sysuser sys_user] [--domain domain_name]
[--local=false] [--passwordfile filename][--secure|-s]
Refer to the asadmin man pages for additional information on these commands.
Web Services Client Implementation
To install and configure the web services client, refer to the Sun ONE Application
Server Developer's Guide to Clients.
Stopping and Starting the HADB
This section addresses the following topics:
• Stopping the HADB
• Starting the HADB After Stopping
Stopping the HADB
If you are uninstalling, you will need to stop the running HADB on the node where
you are working. The hadbm stop command stops all HADM processes on each
node. It also captures the role of each node and saves this information locally to the
/etc/opt/SUNWhadb/dbdef/mydb/stopstate file. The hadbm start command
references this file so it knows what role to give the nodes when it starts the
database.
To stop a running HADB, perform these steps:
1. Log in as root on the system where the HADB is running.
2. Run the hadbm stop command using the following format:
hadbm stop hadb_name
This command stops the database.
3. Type yes or y to confirm, anything else to cancel. When the HADB is stopped,
the following is displayed:
Database successfully stopped
Stopping and Starting the HADB
86 Sun ONE Application Server Version 7, Enterprise Edition Installation Guide • September 2003
4. Verify the HADB is stopped by running the following command:
hadbm status --nodes hadb_name
The state for all nodes should be Stopped.
Starting the HADB After Stopping
You must issue the hadbm start command from the host where you issued the
hadbm stop command because the stopstate file is on that host and the
stopstate file is needed for the hadbm start command.
To start all active nodes of an HADB after it has been stopped using the hadbm stop
command, perform these steps:
1. Log in as root on the system where the HADB resides.
2. Run the hadbm start command from the host where you issued the hadbm
stop command using the following format:
hadbm start hadb_name
After the HADB has started, the following is displayed:
Database successfully started
NOTE If the inetd process was still running, the clu_nsup_srv process
would be running and the state for the nodes (NodeState) would be
Starting.

Troubleshooting
This chapter describes how to solve common problems that might occur during
installation of the Sun ONE Application Server 7, Enterprise Edition software.
The following topics are addressed here:
• About Logs and Messages
• J2SE Installation/Upgrade Issues
• Forgotten User Name or Password
• Forgotten Admin Server Port Number
• Connection Refused for Administration Interface
• Server Won’t Start: CGI Error Occurs
• Uninstallation Failure Cleanup
About Logs and Messages
Both the installation and uninstallation programs create log files and log all
installation and uninstallation events to these files. The primary purpose of these
log files is to provide troubleshooting information.
In addition to installation program messages and log files, operating system
utilities such as pkginfo and showrev on Solaris can be used to gather system
information.
Log file entries include information about the attempted action, the outcome of the
action, and, if applicable, the cause of failure. The log files contain the following
types of message entries:
J2SE Installation/Upgrade Issues
94 Sun ONE Application Server Version 7, Enterprise Edition Installation Guide • September 2003
• INFO—These messages mark normal completion of a particular installation
tasks.
• WARNING—These messages mark non-critical failures. Warning messages
generally contain information about the cause and the nature of the failure, and
also provide possible remedies.
• ERROR—These messages mark critical failures that cause installation or
uninstallation status to be reported as Failed. Error messages generally provide
detailed information about the nature and the cause of the problem that
occurred.
For a full listing of the Sun ONE Application Server error messages, refer to the
Enterprise Edition of the Sun ONE Application Server Error Messages Reference.
The following Application Server logs can be useful for troubleshooting:
• For problems you may have with the installation or uninstallation process:
/var/sadm/install/logs/Sun_ONE_Application_Server_install.log
/var/sadm/install/logs/Sun_ONE_Application_Server_uninstall.log
• In addition to these log files, low-level installation and uninstallation log files
are created at these locations:
/var/sadm/install/logs/Sun_ONE_Application_Server_install.<timestamp>
/var/sadm/install/logs/Sun_ONE_Application_Server_uninstall.<timestamp>
• For problems with the clsetup command:
/var/tmp/clsetup.log
• For problems with the cladmin command:
/var/tmp/cladmin.log
J2SE Installation/Upgrade Issues
The installation program can only upgrade your J2SE installation when the
following requirements are met:
1. The following Solaris J2SE packages reside on the machine where you are
performing installation:
? SUNWj3rt
? SUNWj3dev
J2SE Installation/Upgrade Issues
Chapter 6 Troubleshooting 95
? SUNWj3man
? SUNWj3dmo
Verify this by running the pkginfo -i -l command on these packages.
2. The version of the Solaris J2SE packages is greater than or equal to version 1.3
and less than version 1.4.1_03.
3. The /usr/j2se (default) directory is writable by the user performing the
installation.
The following types of errors may occur if you attempt to upgrade your J2SE
during installation:
• Incompatible J2SE version---cannot upgrade.
• Failure to install J2SE reported through install log file.
Incompatible J2SE version---cannot upgrade.
If you receive this type of error, the first or second requirements above have not
been met.
Solution
Resolve your J2SE package or version issues by either fixing the Solaris packages or
completely removing the Solaris packages (only if they are not used by any other
application programs) using the pkgrm command.
If you remove the packages, you can then install the J2SE component using the
installation program by selecting the Install Java 2 SDK (1.4.1_03) option in the Java
Configuration panel.
Failure to install J2SE reported through install
log file.
If you receive this type of error, the third requirement above has not been met.
NOTE The installation program can only upgrade a package-based J2SE
installation, not a file-based J2SE installation.
Forgotten User Name or Password
96 Sun ONE Application Server Version 7, Enterprise Edition Installation Guide • September 2003
Solution
Verify that your /usr/j2se directory is not read-only.
Forgotten User Name or Password
If you do not remember the administrative user name that was supplied during
installation, try these solutions in this order:
1. Enter the user name admin. This is the default user name specified in the server
configuration dialog during installation.
2. If this doesn’t work, look in the following file:
domain_config_dir/domain1/admin-server/config/admpw
This file contains the administrator's user name followed by the encrypted
form of the administrative user's password. Seeing the user name may jog your
memory.
3. If this doesn’t work, delete the administrative domain and recreate it with a
new password.
4. As a last resort, uninstall and reinstall the Sun ONE Application Server.
Forgotten Admin Server Port Number
If you do not remember the HTTP server port number of the Admin Server, you
can inspect the Admin Server's configuration file to determine the HTTP server
port number:
1. Navigate to domain_config_dir/domain1/admin-server/config/ and open the
server.xml file in a text editor.
2. Look for the following element:
http-listener id="http-listener-1" address="0.0.0.0"
port="4848"...
In this case, port 4848 is the HTTP port number in use.
Connection Refused for Administration Interface
Chapter 6 Troubleshooting 97
Connection Refused for Administration Interface
If the connection was refused when attempting to invoke the graphical
Administration interface, it is likely that the Admin Server is not running. The
Admin Server log file may be helpful in determining the reason the Admin Server
is not running.
To start the Admin Server, use the command-line instructions in “Starting and
Stopping the Server” on page 81.
Server Won’t Start: CGI Error Occurs
If the Sun ONE Application Server won’t start, you may receive the following
error:
[05/Aug/2002:01:12:12] SEVERE (21770): cgi_init reports:
HTTP4047: could not initialize CGI subsystem
(Cgistub path /export/home/sun/appserver7/appserv/lib/Cgistub),
err fork() failure [Not enough space]
The system may require additional resources. Possible solutions are described in
the following sections:
• Set Limits on File Descriptions
• On Solaris: Change Kernel Parameters
Set Limits on File Descriptions
You can use the ulimit command to determine the number of available file
descriptors or set limits on the system’s available file descriptors. The ulimit
command displays the limits for the current shell and its descendants.
For the sh shell, the ulimit -a command lists all the current resource limits. The
ulimit -n command lists the maximum file descriptors plus 1.
On Solaris: Change Kernel Parameters
On Solaris, increase the system resources by modifying the /etc/system file to
include the following entries:
Uninstallation Failure Cleanup
98 Sun ONE Application Server Version 7, Enterprise Edition Installation Guide • September 2003
set rlim_fd_max=4086
set rlim_fd_cur=1024
The system will require a reboot for the new kernel parameters to take effect.
After you have set the shell resources, the Sun ONE Application Server should
start.
Uninstallation Failure Cleanup
If an uninstallation fails, you may need to clean up some leftover files or processes
before attempting a new installation.
1. Log in as root.
2. Navigate to your installation directory and check the content of the
/var/sadm/install/productregistry file for installed packages. That is,
check for files having the SUNW string.
cat /var/sadm/install/productregistry | grep SUNW
3. Run pkgrm for the SUNW packages that were found in the product registry file.
For example:
pkgrm SUNWasaco
4. Remove the following files, if they are present:
/tmp/setupSDKNative
/tmp/SolarisNativeToolkit_3.0_1
5. After the packages have been removed, manually remove the Sun ONE
Application Server-specific product registry file itself.
rm /var/sadm/install/productregistry
6. At the command line, find and kill all appservd processes that may be running
by typing the following:
ps -ef | grep appservd
kill -9 PID
7. Remove all remaining files under the Sun ONE Application Server installation
directories.
Uninstallation Failure Cleanup
Chapter 6 Troubleshooting 99
8. If present, remove the following log file:
/var/sadm/install/logs/Sun_ONE_Application_Server_install.log
This is necessary because every iteration of installation appends the log
information to this file if it exists.
